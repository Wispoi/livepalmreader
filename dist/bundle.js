self-respect aiming high and strong personalities, it is easy for these two to take off their clothes and enjoy one another. Their biggest problem could be their possible selfishness. Since sexual harmony is probably the most important segment of the relationship to their sign ruled by Mars, this might lead to fights and the exchange of many sharp words.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe worst possible scenario is if one of them thinks extensively about the other’s satisfaction, while the other has no awareness of the needs of their giving partner. Since Mars is a planet primarily connected to sex as a means to continuation of the species, it is quite often that two Aries partners lack the ability to satisfy each other in a sensual, Venus way. Mars will stand for satisfaction in the physical sense, but no Venus – no emotion. Hence, there might be a lack of true human interaction in this segment of relationship. Their thoughts must be turned to their partner with no exception if they plan for their sexual relationship to work."},"Trust":{"Value":55,"Description":"There is a specific behavior of Aries that almost always shows if they are not telling the truth – they start acting defensive and get angry a lot. Now you can imagine how two Aries would look together if they weren’t honest? Pretty much like children at the playground fighting about nothing at all, while keeping some sort of unnatural closeness to neutralize the feelings of guilt.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith that said, we can claim with certainty that two Aries in a loving relationship share trust as the same goal. Not only trust in what the other person is saying, but more importantly, trust to open up and say what’s on your mind without presence of fear of their partner’s reaction. In many cases, Aries partner is not full of love and support due to their lack of tact and impulsive nature. This is the main reason why two Aries in a relationship don’t always work."},"Intellect":{"Value":85,"Description":"Imagine two handsome, naked people, banging their heads against a brick wall. Sometimes this is the best possible image to make you understand the mindset of Aries, especially when there are two of them, brainstorming. Intelligence has nothing to do with the image, as they can be extremely intelligent due to the possibility of the position of Mercury in their sign, but some kind of strange stubbornness is what can make them senselessly stupid.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe usual Aries brain has a sort of need to always prove something to others. Now this would be great if the debate had some calm, rational thinking as a base, but even when their arguments are valid, they can’t seem to stay calm and distant for long enough to make their opinion be heard.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe good side of this combination is in fact the same position of the Sun as signification of awareness, so you can see that their main focus doesn’t differ that much. Still, it is difficult for two of them to find peace in communicating, unless they share most of the same opinions.\\r\\n\\r\\nMars, their ruler, is in its low energy set – a planet of aggression. When you try to pin previous description to your Aries couple, you may not find it valid. But if you look again, you might see all types of hidden aggression between them, especially if they are tired. It is as if they are used to it and now they simply function in this way. Look again – it may be physical or verbal, active or passive. Is it there?"},"Emotions":{"Value":75,"Description":"Due to their impatience it is easy to assume that Aries representatives aren’t very emotional. There is no better person than another Aries to understand how untrue this assumption is. As a Fire sign, Aries is warm and passionate but it can be a bit difficult to understand their soft side because of their seemingly “masculine” and soldier-like nature. Two Aries can share deep emotional understanding as if they speak the same language.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately, Sun is exalted in Aries and often too warm for their balanced functioning. If a second Sun would enter our solar system, can you imagine what kind of damage its gravity would do? This said, you can understand that it is easier to be with a person ruled by a planet when you yourself are a star. It is not as if this emotional relationship is impossible, but it can sometimes be difficult for both parties to remain independent, strong and true to their self."},"Values":{"Value":95,"Description":"The thing Aries value most is a person’s ability to be straightforward and clear, so two Aries will understand each other perfectly on this matter. If they would agree on specifics, that is questionable. Because of their primal nature, they like to see themselves as fighters for justice. This gives them a typical “Robin Hood” perspective, so it is possible to say that they also value truth, honor and respect. This would be out of context and more of an “in general” description of their values. Values any other sign could also have, but not be that passionate about them."},"Activities":{"Value":95,"Description":"Mars makes people active, so let’s say they can share everything physical, from walks, sports and sex, to mountaineering. Activities to be shared are easily found in this relationship because of their similar energy type and potential."},"Summary":{"Value":75,"Description":"When two Aries come together, it is imperative for at least one of them to have mastered the art of staying calm. If this is achieved by one of them, not through passive aggression but through rational thought, their relationship can be truly rewarding. As two warm and passionate people, they can share many adventurous moments that raise their energy levels sky high. If, however, none of them has this rational, grown-up ability, it is only possible to prolong their relationship based on superficial activities and sex, of course. Since the sign of Aries takes Saturn, the wise ruler of time, patience and responsibility to its detriment, one of these partners will have to learn their lesson and take responsibility for the future of their relationship if they are to last in time."}},"Taurus":{"Love":{"Value":65,"Description":"The fact that Aries is ruled by Mars and Taurus by Venus immediately shows us how sexual these signs are. Both planets are in connection with physical relations, but their biggest difference is in their final goal when it comes to sex.\\r\\n\\r\\nAries in its rough form is guided by a simple instinct, the need for continuation of the species and the transfer of genetic material to the next generation. On the other hand, Taurus is all about satisfaction. They don’t even consider orgasm that big of a deal if they are enjoying themselves through the entire sexual experience. To satisfy Taurus, you need to be emotionally involved, gentle and passionate at the same time, and willing to put some time and effort into the art of sex. Aries representatives usually get satisfied with having sexual relations at all. This goes for both male and female representatives of the sign.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor their mutual satisfaction it is imperative for Aries to develop an atypical sense of touch and work on their sensuality in order to keep their Taurus happy. Let us also remember that Taurus is a fixed sign, pretty much set in their ways, and when it comes to sexual satisfaction they will rarely compromise and settle for less than perfect.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Trust":{"Value":85,"Description":"Both of these signs have the ability to form a stable relationship filled with honesty. Neither of them is flaky or runs away from a good challenge. This can contribute to a positive attitude and open agreements on honesty when they are together. They both have a need to search for their one true love, as Mars and Venus always do. This can lead to infidelity and typical love triangle issues, due to lack of emotion from Aries or a lack of self-worth by Taurus partner. Still, if they communicate well from the beginning, they will usually find how important mutual trust is to both of them and try hard not to jeopardize it"},"Intellect":{"Value":40,"Description":"It is quite obvious that Aries and Taurus both have horns. This is an image you should definitely keep in mind while analyzing their communication skills. Not only are they both stubborn, but they are not even stubborn in a similar way to share some understanding.\\r\\n\\r\\nAries grabs their convictions and simply doesn’t let go. They will kick and scream (literally) until they convince Taurus that they are right about something (consider it the smallest thing in the entire Universe). When Taurus notices this Aries’ behavior, they dig in. They don’t move. Ever. They don’t even possess the sense of sound. You can almost expect a deep voiced “moo” as they get more and more irritated. Their shoulders go up, their eyebrows make an “M” and they simply stand there, annoying their Aries partner even more.\\r\\n\\r\\nWho could be this inhuman to just stand there and not listen to a word their loved one says in that high pitched tone? Taurus can. Not because of the anger, but because they are in fact too sensitive to deal with this kind of behavior. Taurus never looks too sensitive. Their Venus role is grounded and strong, but this is a sign in which the Moon is exalted, Uranus falls and Mars is in detriment. You can imagine how this person can react to shouting and aggression of any kind.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir intellect is not an issue at all. If they can find their way through those hardheaded conflicts, it is all the same if they were intelligent or stupid because they must love each other very much.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cure for this condition is in the middle, of course. Taurus needs to set strong boundaries and act securely from the safe zone they’ve created and Aries needs to take a step back and lower their voice, just a little bit. This would be a good place to start"},"Emotions":{"Value":60,"Description":"These are both highly emotional signs, but they don’t show it in the same way. It is safe to assume that as much as they may love each other, it will be difficult for both of them to know they are loved. Although some of the rituals can be taught in time, this is not a solution if they don’t feel enough closeness.\\r\\n\\r\\nAries shows their emotions loudly and openly, in a way that is sort of rough and inpatient. They don’t give much time for the other person to give an emotion back, and act as Fire, their element, without much sense for anyone. Taurus may find this superficial, too intense or even phony, as they don’t recognize this type of behavior as love. Taurus shows their emotions in a silent, slow process of giving. They will show love through cooking, touching and gentle words. The problem is in the fact that Aries finds this boring, stiff or even untrue.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo make each another feel loved, they will both have to learn to show affection to their partner in a way that differs a lot from their natural one. This can be a small or a large obstacle and the outcome depends only on their readiness to listen to the needs of their loved one."},"Values":{"Value":90,"Description":"This is an area in which they match quite well. Although they seem completely different, their main objectives are pretty much the same. They both value material security, since Aries is ruled by Mars, a planet connected to the fear of existential crisis, and Taurus is an Earth sign, material in their core and very inclined to the financial world. They both cherish character and strength, physical and verbal, and need someone who will not disappoint them as the first impression fades\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Activities":{"Value":40,"Description":"Aries and Taurus really want completely different things. While Aries is active, ready to run, train and needs to use the energy through any kind of physical activity, Taurus has the need to rest and gather energy almost all the time. Even if they go for coffee together, there is a big chance Aries partner will finish theirs and be bored in about 20 minutes, while Taurus partner would sip their coffee enjoying it, than order some cake. The only activity they would both truly enjoy is a walk through the park and any slow outdoor activity to restore contact with nature"},"Summary":{"Value":63,"Description":"This is a relationship full of personal challenges and individual depth. If they want to succeed as a couple, many internal issues in both must be solved. Only if they both accomplish peace in their lives, have just enough education, just enough other relationships and acquired just enough humor, they might be able to put aside their differences and listen to each other well enough. It is not that hard, except when you are used to using your horns"}},"Gemini":{"Love":{"Value":90,"Description":"When Aries and Gemini engage in sexual activities, who knows where they could end up. With Aries’ libido and Gemini’s ideas, they might be a bit too creative and harshly judged by their environment. It is a good thing that they both don’t care that much about other’s opinions anyway. In its healthy image, this is mostly a combination of passion, energy and curiosity. In a not so healthy one, their sexual relationship can be full of nasty words and verbal aggression. The good thing is that neither is too sensitive and easily hurt, so this can be exciting and unique for both of their experiences.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince Aries is a warrior by nature, Gemini’s approach to sex might be too playful for their taste, but this is usually only until they open up to the everlasting game provided by Gemini partner. Their main goal is to stay as uninhibited as possible, so the Air sign of Gemini can give oxygen to the Fire of Aries\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Trust":{"Value":40,"Description":"Lack of trust is probably the biggest problem in this relationship. Aries is passionate, ruled by Mars and possibly very jealous. Gemini is ruled by Mercury, the zodiac’s trickster, always changing the face they wear for the world. Most Gemini representatives aren’t even aware of their basic individuality, convinced that they change personality overnight. Although this is not exactly true, the sense that Aries can get from them is not exactly a recipe for trust. Because of this, Aries might get angry, Gemini distracted and distant, to the point where Aries starts looking for another partner even if the relationship has not ended and Gemini doesn’t even care anymore"},"Intellect":{"Value":85,"Description":"Aries is simply not the master of the art of conversation. Gemini is a sign ruled by Mercury and conversation is their main life theme. Even if they talk less than a typical Gemini usually does, their inner dialogue must be rich. Both partners should approach the relationship as if Gemini person was there to teach Aries how to have a good conversation. Since Gemini loves to be in a role of a teacher and loves to be in a relationship in which their partner learns something from them, this should be a good approach for both of them. That is if Aries’ ego allows this “submissive” role.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, we are all aware that there are some Gemini representatives that simply talk too much about nothing significant at all. This would be a reason for Aries to lose their temper and think of their partner as superficial and even stupid. This loss of respect is truly bad for their own ego, since the decision to be with this partner was theirs in the first place. They should remember that there is always somebody in the world who wouldn’t think of this specific Gemini as stupid and that everyone deserves to be with someone who doesn’t see them in this light. When this disrespect happens in their relationship, Aries should consider letting their Gemini go and look for someone who suits them better."},"Emotions":{"Value":60,"Description":"Emotional realm is a tricky territory for this couple. Aries partner has warm, passionate emotions and a problem to express them. Gemini often doesn’t go very deep beneath the surface to look for someone’s hidden qualities and isn’t really that emotional by nature. So this is a mix of an emotional partner who can’t communicate how they feel, and a rational one who talks about everything else. The good thing is that Aries does not lack the fierceness to turn Gemini’s attention to them and make them listen. When they manage to connect in a constructive dialogue, it is possible for them to explain to each other where they stand and how they feel, and this way set a good foundation for future emotional exchange."},"Values":{"Value":75,"Description":"When you calculate the fact that Aries values a person’s ability to be clear and concise, and Gemini’s need to talk around everything, it seems pretty obvious that this is not a perfect match. Now think of Gemini. It is kind of hard to think of any of their values except for the fact that they value everything interesting, and this is a kind of understatement since they find almost everything interesting. Well this is not exactly true. Gemini partners value knowledge and someone’s literal abilities, as well as a fine rational mind. This is something Aries can fulfill to a certain point, in case they don’t react on impulse to everything Gemini says.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not that difficult for these partners to respond to each other’s needs, but if they don’t share similar education, interests and strength of character, they might see each other unworthy of their affection."},"Activities":{"Value":50,"Description":"Gemini is all for activity however insane certain activities might be, and Aries will feel liberated in this relationship. It is hard to say who will lead and who will follow, as Aries always leads with that atomic energy, while Gemini always comes up with new ideas and initiative. They motivate and challenge each other all the time and they both never say “no”. Choices of activities Aries come up with must be truly aggressive and ridiculous for Gemini not to engage. If Gemini thinks of something that Aries would maybe like to refuse, their ego wouldn’t let them and they would jump in anyway, just to prove that they can. This much excitement should be followed by enough rest and time spent at home."},"Summary":{"Value":74,"Description":"The overall impression of this couple would be good, exciting and challenging, a relationship where both partners can learn a lot and be active in a healthy way. The main problem with their romantic involvement is the lack of trust, especially if Aries partner gets too attached to Gemini, always fighting for their freedom. The need for conversation with a lot of essence is bigger than any positive or any negative aspects of their relationship and both of them should always have this in mind. In general, there is a big chance these two will end up together, because their shared love of adventure is bigger than most of their troubles."}},"Cancer":{"Love":{"Value":70,"Description":"We usually see the sign of Cancer as extremely asexual. Our family is presented by the sign of Cancer and the Moon, and it is a psychological challenge for all of us to understand that our parents are sexual beings. This would be fine if the members of this universal Cancer family weren’t convinced in their asexual nature as well. Their emotional characteristics allow only for sexual relationships with meaning and enough tenderness. Only when they meet the right person to set them free, they come to learn about the other aspects of their sexuality.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem with sexual relations with an Aries is that Aries partners are usually not that gentle to begin with. They need to learn to show emotion. For them intimacy is something built, not implied. If they manage to reconcile these huge differences at the beginning of their relationship and if none of them is forced to do anything they are not ready for, their attraction to each other should do the trick and their sexual relationship could become truly sensual and exciting for both of them."},"Trust":{"Value":50,"Description":"The issue of trust is something different for this couple. They will rarely debate about their trust in each other’s fidelity. Usually the problem they encounter is a trust issue when it comes to intimacy. Aries has a different view on intimacy. In the eyes of their Cancer partner they can seem pushy and even aggressive with an attitude that doesn’t lead to anything close to relaxed. As much as Cancer would like to understand the straightforward nature of Aries, it will be extremely difficult to see it as anything other than beastly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is also a problem with the way they show and recognize emotions. It may be hard for an Aries partner to understand that they are loved if someone only asks annoying questions, tries to tie them down and doesn’t want to have sex. On the other hand, Cancer will probably feel violated in every way, unless Aries partner slows down and has an atypical show of gentle emotions. Usually any sort of mistrust is a consequence of the lack of ability to believe in each other’s feelings for one another, for they don’t really recognize them well."},"Intellect":{"Value":20,"Description":"Both of these partners have the same tendency to act on an impulse and cut the conversation short before they even got to the point of it. It is not their intention to react in this way, but they push each other’s buttons and it is very hard for them to stay focused and solve the issue they talked about. Their interests differ too much, so even when they are trying to have a peaceful conversation about something impersonal, it is still a battle to keep the attention to the subject in question, whoever initiated the talk.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir only shared characteristic is the cardinal quality of both signs, which gives them a good understanding on each other’s “ad hoc” personalities. This will make it easier for the couple to recover from all of the possible conflicts and misunderstandings. Still, in the eyes of a Cancer partner, this type of relationship doesn’t have a purpose and they might find themselves fighting in a way they don’t feel comfortable with.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs their signs are ruled by Mars and the Moon, it is an archetypal story of hurt and emotional pain, so their intentions have to be truly pure. They have to treat each other in a gentle, thought-out way, measuring every word they say. This can be exhausting for both of them, unless they fully accept the fact that they don’t need to change their personality, only the way they express it and make a game out of it."},"Emotions":{"Value":70,"Description":"Aries and Cancer are both deeply emotional, although Aries is often described as if they had an emotional disability. They are warm, passionate and have high expectations of their partner when it comes to scratching beneath the surface. Their boundaries may be too strict as they fear their own sensitivity and sometimes act like heartless soldiers. Cancer wears their emotions as a winter coat and hides them only when feeling ashamed to show them. They accept their emotional nature as a given and work toward realizing a personal world full of respect for their soft side. We often say that Cancer wants to have a family and raise children, but this is not due to their need to reproduce or stay in the house all day long, but because they need a safe haven for their emotional side and enough people to share their compassionate nature with.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven though these approaches to their emotions seem different, they understand each other’s depth and in most cases respect each other in this area of existence, in case Aries leaves their impatient nature out of their relationship. The problem appears when they are supposed to understand how they feel about each other, as feelings are not easily shown when dealing with partner’s personality they don’t fully understand."},"Values":{"Value":40,"Description":"While Aries gives a lot of significance to someone’s state of energy, focus and consistency, Cancer values the ability to stay rational and stable, qualities they have a difficulty achieving, or being in a state of emotional balance. Their values aren’t even connected, except for the fact they both have the idea that some sort of future balance, that can be quite hard to achieve, would make them better.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Activities":{"Value":30,"Description":"As much as Aries wants to devote to their physical body, sports and all the ways to keep their creative energy high, Cancer wants to sleep, dance and eat all they long. Mostly they share sexual activities and the time for rest, since Cancer probably has no intention of following that insane Aries pace.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Summary":{"Value":47,"Description":"This relationship can be painful for both partners and needs a lot of work put into it in order to work. It requires both of the partners to adapt and make changes in their behavior, while tip toing around each other most of the time. It is not an easy road, but the rewards are such inner understanding of passion, full of emotion and the ability to create something truly unique. If they succeed, they will probably never be satisfied with a different partner."}},"Leo":{"Love":{"Value":90,"Description":"This is such a warm and passionate connection, in which sparks fly around all the time. They have similar sexual preferences and they definitely take each other seriously, whatever the level of their relationship. As they both have extremely strong personalities, they could fight and make up all the time, but enjoy it in a way some Water signs might find crazy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey have a sexual connection that cannot be interrupted, changed or faded through time, since they are both individual sources of energy, waiting for someone to follow. Still, if one of them has issues with their ego, they could slump into an energy drain system, where they insult each other and destroy each other’s confidence and libido. This is a very rare possibility, but it is always there when two signs that present an extraordinary soil for the Sun come together."},"Trust":{"Value":60,"Description":"There are probably many trust issues in every Aries – Leo couple, but their strong convictions and the need for loyalty mend these problems in most cases. They both think highly of themselves and see how their surroundings react to their partner. Leo is a strong willed, attractive masculine sign, and no matter if male or female, they will have this magnetic aura around them most of the time. This will make Aries strangely jealous and possessive, ready to fight for what belongs to them. Exactly why this problem culminates, for no one can ever possess Leo, the King of the zodiac.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, their mutual understanding for the passionate nature they share and the determination of both partners to solve any problem that stands in their way, might just make them stay together for years, building security and trust every day."},"Intellect":{"Value":90,"Description":"At first, their conversations will probably be unbelievably energized, full of admiration and respect. As they get closer, it can be expected for them to put in an emotional note, but not a very gentle one for their emotions burn like the Fire element they belong to. This is a certain promise of a lot of fights, loud statements and interruptions. Interestingly, as two very passionate people, they usually get over their fights quickly and don’t care much about specific words spoken in the heat of the moment. The moment they cool down, their relationship will easily go back to normal and their sexual life will blossom every time they fight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey are interested in similar things. Aries is interested in Leo, while Leo is interested in everything great about Leo. This is a very nice distribution of interests, since Leo will cherish all the things Aries will say and do for them, and give it all back multiple times greater. This is, of course, the scenario of two healthy individuals in these roles. If one of them has greater psychological issues, their communications will turn to senseless talk about one of them, and their relationship will become a battlefield for the ego where they both constantly need to prove something to each other."},"Emotions":{"Value":99,"Description":"Their emotional natures are very similar. Sun is connected to love, pure and simple, not the nurturing kind but the creative, warm, passionate and playful love. Both of these signs have a strongly positioned Sun, growing on the soil made out of the Fire element. They understand each other’s emotional state perfectly, even when one of them would like to flee from the passionate need of the other to give resistance to something small and seemingly irrelevant.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmotional compatibility of this magnitude is a cure for all other imperfections they might encounter, while evolving in time and spicing their sexual relations with even more warmth and emotion then the beginning of their relationship might have promised.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Values":{"Value":95,"Description":"What these two value most is a person’s ability to stay concise and clear. It is almost as if these were the words that describe them. Anything concise needs strong Mars energy, the ruler of Aries, while Leo brings clarity to all. Their only problem is the need they both have to be the leader and the brave one in the relationship. It is not as if they both can’t be brave, but they have a tendency to compare to one another and search for their role as a lead. This can come between them and manifest as a typical battle of the sexes (in case they are of the opposite sex) or as a fight for dominance of any kind, consuming the quality of their relationship only because of their need to be the one with dominant values in general."},"Activities":{"Value":65,"Description":"They have enough energy to do everything together, but the problem is they don’t actually need the same daily routine. Aries loves to be active, walk, exercise and always feels excited when about to do something for the first time. Leo is a sign of fixed quality, a drama queen of signs, the one that wants to show off and go where they can be seen. Leo’s energy is easily focused to coffee shops and places where they can rest, enjoy and be the center of everyone’s attention. This is a waste of time in the eyes of an Aries, always ready for something different and exciting.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor as long as Aries has the will to initiate their shared activities and compromises for a show off from time to time, they can find things to do together and enjoy them. But if Aries partner gets tired and irritated by Leo’s laziness, there is a big chance they will simply separate their activities all together."},"Summary":{"Value":83,"Description":"The relationship of Aries and Leo is passionate and turbulent, but they don’t seem to mind an occasional fight and a sharp word. When they fall in love deeply, they are almost impossible to separate as they stubbornly hold on to the idea of their future together. Although they are not two of the most romantic believers in love, they are passionate in their beliefs and when they find love, they will fight for it until there is literally nothing left of their relationship.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is meaningless to advise gentle behavior or looking for peace, because the entire world of their relationship is based on the element of Fire they share. It is pointless to look for peace, when the opposite of peace is what attracts them in the first place. For as long as they love each other and stay faithful and true, they will be tied up in a relationship they need to fight for every day. Their main objective is to find a way to enjoy the fight and have fun.\\r\\n\\r\\n"}},"Virgo":{"Love":{"Value":10,"Description":"It is hard to say if Aries and Virgo would present the clumsiest or simply the worst couple when it comes to sex. Aries may look at Virgo and think of Virgin Mary, her chastity and what we would call a total absence of sex. There is nothing more asexual for Aries than a person without an obvious sexual identity. To express their sexuality or feel sexual at all, Virgo needs patience, verbal stimulation and a lot of foreplay. This is where Aries comes in as a brute with no manners or tact what so ever, to sweep them of their feet with a passionate nature that looks superficial and completely unattractive. The real question is – how did these two get attracted to each other in the first place?\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir intimate life can be good only in case Aries accepts to wait and communicate about things they don’t find important at all, or if Virgo was so disappointed in their previous relationships that they turned into a sexual predator, open for an interesting turn in their intimate life."},"Trust":{"Value":70,"Description":"In case they overcome their sexual difficulties and stay together against odds, their problems with trust shouldn’t be significant. Aries usually has the need to be honorable and straightforward, except in rare cases when they cannot contain their sexual appetites. In most relationships, Virgo is obviously faithful and hates being lied to. This is why they have a need to be honest and ask for honesty in return."},"Intellect":{"Value":30,"Description":"These two can be so annoying to each other that they might annoy everyone around them. When you think of a partner who brings out the best in you, Aries and Virgo are the worst possible match. The downside of an Aries partner is their impulsive nature, readiness to fight and the tendency to lose their mind over something that might not be that big of a deal. The possible downside of Virgo is hysteria and continuous, never ending talks, when they are not understood.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a known fact that Virgo likes things clean. Well Aries is like an animal in their cage, especially if they are crazy enough to decide to live together. This could lead to endless, pointless fights, because Aries will never change their nature, or their priorities, while Virgo will seem like a crazy person screaming, with gloves on and a huge bottle of antiseptic liquid in their hand. The good thing is that before they get to this stage of the relationship, they will probably find each other extremely repellent and break up instead.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo good that could come out of this strange bond is their intellectual cooperation, in case they share the same interests or work. They will awake each other’s intelligence, challenge each other’s mind and probably think of entirely different, but constructive solutions for problems that might occur."},"Emotions":{"Value":20,"Description":"When it comes to emotions, we could say that their emotional compatibility is better than their sexual one. Still, as Virgo is primarily an intellectual sign, a sign where Venus falls and the lack of emotion is evident, and Aries usually mixes up love and sexual attraction, it is hard to achieve a quality emotional connection between them. Their best chance for love would be the silent observation by Virgo partner for some time before they get together, because this would give a rational advantage in knowing the person they are starting a relationship with. It would also be good for Aries to think before acting, not a usual thing they would do.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they knew each other as friends, going through their emotional experiences with other people prior to them becoming a couple, they could know each other well enough to make their relationship work. When Aries goes from friendship into a sexual relationship, they tend to be much more considerate and gentle. Without sexual involvement Aries is more tolerant and a better listener, so friendship will provide more substance to their romantic relationship."},"Values":{"Value":50,"Description":"They both value hard work and ambition, as well as clear and sharply deduced information. This is what makes them great as colleagues, but this is not exactly the most important set of values a happy couple would share. Their relationship could be based on their joint business though. This would give more meaning to their conversations and everyday life.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther things they value don’t coincide that much. Aries is all for bravery and an attitude while Virgo thinks of these as stupid, unless they are a part of tradition or have historic significance. Virgo values intelligence while Aries thinks success has nothing to do with it and sees it as a possible reason for loneliness and sorrow. Still, these would rather be the reasons to tease each other and have a nice laugh, than they would have the capacity to tear their relationship apart."},"Activities":{"Value":70,"Description":"It is a good thing that Virgo is a sign of mutable quality and always concerned about their health, or they would never think about following Aries to their activities. Still, there is always a chance that Virgo will use their health to get out of these activities and spend some time alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a couple that could go for a run because it’s healthy, spend time in the nature because it’s healthy, think about their bodies together because it’s healthy, have regular intimate relations, once a week, because it’s healthy and to sum up, anything that’s healthy would be easy to incorporate in their relationship. Also, it is a very good thing that Aries doesn’t care much about “empty time”, such as watching television or opening solitaire, because Virgo would rather read or clean than subject to these activities for the “permanent damage of the brain”.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem in this area of their relationship is connected to activities that don’t leave much sense of dignity or make careful Virgo feel scared, or the activities too boring for an Aries personality."},"Summary":{"Value":42,"Description":"It’s a good thing that the relationship between an Aries and a Virgo is never boring. Although in most cases they are not really meant to last, it can still be a fun experience if none of them takes their potential for a shared future too seriously. In case they take the best out of their relationship, giving it enough freedom and unpredictability, Virgo would incorporate some of Aries’ energy, while Aries would allow Virgo to teach them how to organize their thoughts and communicate calmly. This way they might come to the point where their relationship could actually last, and the outcome depends on their ability to relax and have fun together."}},"Libra":{"Love":{"Value":80,"Description":"Although Aries and Libra are both signs of masculine nature, they are a primal opposition of the zodiac and present a relationship between Mars and Venus, planets in charge of our sex life. When they engage in intimate relations, it is expected for all their libido and possible problems with sexual expression to surface. Attraction they feel toward each other is great, but their signs combined present passive-aggressive behavior in general and as a couple they could have a tendency to hurt each other in intimate relations.\\r\\n\\r\\nRuled by Mars, Aries is a sign of Saturn’s debilitation and Libra exalts it, so their main issue is the lack of emotion and poor boundaries when it comes to sex. Saturn can cool things a bit too much and be a challenge to overcome in their attempts to get sincerely close. When they connect through real emotion and respect each other’s boundaries, they have a potential for a very good sex life, as Aries gives initiative and energy to indecisive Libra, lifting their libido and Libra awakens the fineness of Aries, teaching them how to be selfless lovers and enjoy thinking about the satisfaction of their partner."},"Trust":{"Value":40,"Description":"Trust is not their forte and problems with it could torture them for years. Libra partner has a problem with insecurity in general and needs to show their worth through relationships with different people. They love to be loved and seem to be hungry for the approval of those around them. Aries finds this stupid but easily gets jealous and threaten their mutual sense of stability and belief in other person’s choices.\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to Libra’s lack of confidence, it is also possible that they will doubt everything their partner does. Since Aries doesn’t put much time or thought into their actions, the lack of conversation about every single detail from their personal life could easily arise suspicion in the mind of a Libra. The most important thing here is for Libra to work on their self-esteem and keep their focus on their own life instead of trying to blend into the life of their partner."},"Intellect":{"Value":55,"Description":"Aside from possible conflicts Libra tries to flee from most of the time, their communication usually serves to feed the hungry Sun of a Libra partner, or Aries’ hungry Saturn. Their opposition covers the points of debilitation and exaltation of Saturn and Sun, and this is mainly shown in their communication and everyday functioning. This means that their role in each other’s life is quite simple – Aries needs to boost their Libra partner’s spirits all the time, showing them how capable and brave they can be, while Libra takes on the responsibilities of their Aries partner and shows them how to reach a certain goal. All of this can be quite tiresome at times, especially if one of them has a problem with this unconditional role play, or doesn’t recognize the effort of their partner.\\r\\n\\r\\nMostly they will talk about their daily activities and events since they don’t share many interests. While talking about different activities and people, they find a common language as Aries helps Libra not to obsess about others and Libra helps Aries to understand different views than their own. Their communication might be great if they were in the same profession or at least share a workplace, because that would cover the basic interests they share and give them more space to find the middle between their opinions."},"Emotions":{"Value":99,"Description":"As crazy as this may seem with lack of qualities their relationship might suffer, this is a couple that understands each other very well when it comes to emotions. Aries can awake Libra’s ability to show them because of their own openness. This is something every Libra needs, as they have trouble letting their guard down. Libra, on the other hand, has enough depth to look inside Aries personality instead of superficially examining their behavior. Of all the zodiac signs, Libra is probably one of the few that have good understanding of the nature of Aries. They don’t understand their actions and their way of display of emotion, but the core of emotion and sensitive personality is easy to reach from their perspective.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is safe to say that this is a couple that could solve any issue with love they have for each other and although their troubles could be great, this is possibly such a deep emotional connection that all problems fade next to it."},"Values":{"Value":70,"Description":"Our values set the direction that leads us to our goal for personal development. Aries has a goal in the sign of Capricorn for this is the sign in their tenth house. Capricorn is ruled by Saturn that exalts in Libra. In the practical sense, this means that Libra helps Aries achieve their goals, while following necessary values. This is an interesting observation because the sign of Aries is the sign of Saturn’s debilitation and doesn’t seem to understand the set of values or exact steps that would lead them to their goal. It is almost as if Libra knew the way for Aries to reach their goals by discovering new values in relationship with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general, their individual values are different in so many ways, but it is exactly the purpose of their relationship to question them and set them straight. Aries values direct, energized approach and outspoken people. Libra values tact, fineness and prestige. While Aries gives their best to live in the now, Libra examines the past to set distant targets in the future. They have a lot to learn from each other, but if they do, they might just set their mutual values somewhere in the middle."},"Activities":{"Value":30,"Description":"This is the couple that finds it very difficult to coordinate their activities. They want to do opposite things most of the time, and the only activity they always agree on sharing is sexual activity. Although this is a pillar for a good relationship and everything else they cannot share might seem irrelevant for some time, they need to find a way to do something else they both enjoy. Even if they don’t, their relationship might work, but only if Libra partner lets go of their idea that they need to include their partner in everything they do. Aries could help Libra by supporting their independence in any possible way, while accepting involvement in a part of activities Libra cares about.  \\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Summary":{"Value":62,"Description":"However difficult it might be to reconcile these two natures, remember that this is a primal opposition that represents partners by signification. Aries and Libra are the couple of the zodiac, as much as any other opposing signs, for they are each other’s seventh house, house of relationships. Even more so if we acknowledge the fact that Libra is the sign of relationships in general. Any problem they might have with each other is something to be worked on, because it shows what their personal problem with any relationship is. When they are madly attracted to each other and fall in love, there is almost nothing that could separate them, no matter the differences. Wouldn’t we all like to find the middle ground with our loved one? They need to work on their bond, that’s a fact, but their relationship is a promise of a perfect fit of two souls meant to be together."}},"Scorpio":{"Love":{"Value":50,"Description":"Aries and Scorpio are signs with an unbreakable bond. Aries is our first breath, Scorpio is the last. They are two sides of the same coin, both ruled by Mars, a planet of instincts, necessities of the body and sexuality as one of these. When they are in a sexual relationship, it can be difficult to set all of the aggression aside. Not only are they both ruled by Mars, but Scorpio is ruled by Pluto, too. Pluto is known for its destructive qualities, usually related to sexual repression and it can intensify all things, sex primarily. So they are basically a combination of everything we don’t want to deal with when it comes to sex, taboos and instinctive sexual behavior.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a contact that lacks pleasures and tenderness of Venus. Both signs are the opposite of ones ruled by Venus and represent positions where Venus is in detriment. We could say that this means “lack of love”, but it is not quite that simple. Since Scorpio is a Water sign, it is connected to our deepest, darkest ability to love. Scorpios need to feel emotion in their sexual experiences, but due to suppressive nature of our society, can live out some weird sexual scenarios that may seem “sick and twisted” to more conservative zodiac signs. It is a good thing that Aries rarely belongs to this category, for it is a sign where all conservative and rigid opinions have fallen with Saturn.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Aries and Scorpio find an understanding inside their sexual relationship, they will probably become the atomic bomb of all sexual experiences you can think of. Still, it is hard for them to find their shared language. They are, in fact, completely different. Aries likes things “straight” and simple. Scorpio, on the other hand, has a slight need to manipulate, play a game of seduction and takes sexual relations very seriously. They always want to transcend all of their previous sexual experiences and find someone they can merge their Soul with, to possess and adore until they die. Aries is much more simple and masculine when it comes to sex. It is a physical need that needs to be met. They usually have to build emotion inside a sexual relationship as they get to know their partner. This relationship’s real possibility exists only if they share the need to satisfy one another and treat each other with enough tenderness."},"Trust":{"Value":90,"Description":"As opposed to sexual compatibility, this issue is easy for them. “If you lie, you die.” Not literally, of course, but a small lie could easily end their relationship. They are both jealous and possessive by nature. Aries likes to win and be the best lover and partner anyone has ever had. Scorpio wants to be the only one that was ever loved by their Aries partner. If they have doubts about each other’s actions, it is very likely they won’t last very long."},"Intellect":{"Value":20,"Description":"Aries will probably tap their foot impatiently while Scorpio goes on and on about all those deep and meaningful things. From the perspective of Aries, this is something nobody should think about, let alone talk about all of the time. This wouldn’t be expressed as boredom (although this is always an option with Aries), but more as a need to act and stop obsessing about everything. Scorpio is too dark and difficult for Aries, as much as Aries is too shallow from Scorpio’s perspective. What they both enjoy though is their shared ability to give a lot of information in only a sentence or two, but this could interfere with their communication even more, since they might say everything they need to in a couple of minutes and have nothing to talk about afterwards."},"Emotions":{"Value":1,"Description":"It is really easy for Scorpio to get hurt here. It seems like they jumped into this relationship only for this reason, so they can repay some sort of a karmic debt. Aries will probably never know or understand what happened in Scorpio’s emotional world because they simply didn’t sense anything.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey don’t have a strong affection to emotion in general and they are both trying hard to be strong and unemotional. This is due to the archetypal “battle” of Mars with the Moon – the rejection of one’s emotional Self and too much roughness in order to survive. Since there is no one here to keep the emotional balance between them, it will be very easy for them to openly “cut” one another, possibly many times, before one of them decides to cut their bond entirely."},"Values":{"Value":40,"Description":"It is a good thing they both value bravery and things that are concrete and clear. Still, they part ways in their further processing of these.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Aries considers something is done with as soon as it’s cleared, Scorpio will dig for reasons why it would be unclear, or was unclear in the first place. So when together, they would both feel the need to clear things up, but Scorpio will obsess about them even when issues are solved and find new details that need to be cleared up, again and again. They need to be productive and fully independent, or they will drive their Aries partner crazy.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it comes to bravery, Aries thinks of bravery as a knight’s tale, something to show when you are wearing your sword, while Scorpio thinks it is brave to sink into the darkness of the mind, go to the underground, the underworld or challenge the devil himself. This is exactly where the difference in their deep levels of the nature of Mars comes to light. Although everything seems the same, nothing is even remotely close to being similar at all, as soon as you scratch beneath the surface."},"Activities":{"Value":99,"Description":"You could say that their main shared activity is sex. Everything else is secondary anyway."},"Summary":{"Value":48,"Description":"Think of this combination of signs through the most aggressive image of Fire and Water element. Fire evaporates Water, just like Aries shatters Scorpio’s feelings. Water damps down Fire, just like Scorpio wears Aries out. They seem to bring out the worst in each other and this is nobody’s fault, it is just hard to reconcile so much focused energy that moves in two different directions. Their relationship is like the process of nuclear fusion and often just too much to handle.\\r\\n\\r\\n"}},"Sagittarius":{"Love":{"Value":95,"Description":"This is a relationship disturbed mostly by the lack of trust and the ability of both parties to open up to their partner. Aries is ruled by Mars, the planet that rules our first chakra, responsible for our ability to set good boundaries. Pisces is ruled by Neptune, in charge of our entire aura and our permeability for outside stimuli. Since they are both responsible for our border with the outside world, it is hard to say which partner should loosen up and make it possible for them to come close. Their only chance of a happy ending is if Aries partner dives in and their Pisces partner wakes up.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Trust":{"Value":70,"Description":"Aries and Sagittarius are both aware of the excessive need for honesty in their life. Usually they don’t have to talk much to understand each other and can easily spot when the other one is lying. This makes it extremely hard to create a situation of mistrust, especially because of the feeling of security Sagittarius partner gives to Aries, by taking everything in with dignity and serenity. In most situations Aries feels they can share anything with their Sagittarius partner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem could appear if they have different views on the seriousness and depth of their relationship. If this is the case, usually a Sagittarius partner sees Aries as a short term, not that important partner. This is why they could easily cheat on them and probably wouldn’t even call it cheating. In return, Aries partner that values their relationship more, would jump into their possessive nature with even more ease and never trust their Sagittarius partner again.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Intellect":{"Value":90,"Description":"This is a wonderful bond that is often seen in friendships that last for years. Their mutual understanding can be so deep, that even if they lack physical attraction, they would gladly substitute it with a life spent in this kind of intellectual relationship. They motivate and push each other wherever they might like to go. When they are together, they make each other feel as if nothing is impossible. While Aries gives initiative and focus, Sagittarius gives vision and faith.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese signs are ruled by Mars and Jupiter, which means that they could have some disagreements on their convictions. In case these are not convictions they think of as their personality’s foundation, this shouldn’t be a huge problem. Still, it is possible for their set of beliefs to differ too much for them to even understand each other. When this happens, they fight whenever and wherever they can, since none of them has the ability to let their convictions go. Aries because they want to win, and Sagittarius because convictions are their forte and something they have surely thought about a lot."},"Emotions":{"Value":90,"Description":"When they fall in love with each other, deeply and sincerely, it is almost possible for their passers-by to warm up in the middle of winter. These are extremely warm signs, due to their corresponding element of Fire, open for any kind of activity just to share time together and feel that wonderful emotion in their stomach. This is a love that could last for a very long time, for as long as their respect their personal needs, individuality and the distance they possibly need from each other every once in a while.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough they are not considered very emotional, it is a mistake to assign emotionality only to the element of Water. This is an element which works from the heart and you can feel it in your chest. In search for an explanation of emotional nature of Fire signs, you should just imagine that warm feeling in your belly and that would be the best possible description. Their emotions are active, warm and on the move. Always changeable but creative and there to move them anywhere they want to go."},"Values":{"Value":70,"Description":"Aries partner values things that are brought up to a higher level by their Sagittarius. In time they will both understand that Aries grows through this relationship and widens their entire system of values. When they started dating, Aries probably had this idea of honor and heroic “sweep off feet” logic. In time, they both must have realized that Sagittarius gives this idea a new step up and brings it into a world of royalty. Not only does Sagittarius value honorable and heroic people, too, but they value honorable people with blue blood that give money and food to the poor, every day.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir main difference is in the fact that Aries values things concise and clear, while Sagittarius will easily disperse and go around the point for days. This can be met through their mutual value of truth, so honesty can be their cure for anything."},"Activities":{"Value":99,"Description":"Aries is a sign in which Saturn falls. This means that they easily get tired or just bored and they always need new and exciting stimulations. Sagittarius is a sign of mutable quality, ready to change whatever needs changing in order to feel good. When they get together, their activities can be shared and fun whatever they are. This has nothing to do with their needs and tendencies, but with the potential of their entire relationship. They can go for coffee and they would have fun, but they could also go bungee jumping together and have even more fun. It is all the same to them. They are fully capable of respecting each other’s personality, so even if their wishes for certain activities differ, this would be easily dealt with.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Summary":{"Value":87,"Description":"This is definitely a couple with lots of potential. They might have to stand up to their environment and defend their feelings from others, but this won’t shake them too much, for neither of them thinks that much about the opinion of others anyway. If they manage to mend their philosophical differences and respect each other’s different opinions, they could become one of the warmest relationships in the zodiac. Their main relationship advice would be to always tell the truth to each other and not go crazy about their healthy differences. Their differences are exactly the thing that could make their sexual life more exciting."}},"Capricorn":{"Love":{"Value":5,"Description":"This is a very difficult combination of signs when it comes to sexual compatibility. Rulers of Aries and Capricorn are Mars and Saturn. These planets are considered archetypal or karmic enemies. When it comes to sexuality, it is mostly signified by Mars and its contact with Saturn may result in all sorts of physical and objective obstacles on the way to a healthy sex life. Saturn puts too much pressure on Mars and takes a lot of its energy. Their relationship will result in lack of sexual desire, the mutual feeling of incompetence or even impotence of one or both included parties.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen this sort of relationship happens, it is in most cases triggered by some deep unconscious need to be held back and restricted when it comes to sexuality. As with everything that comes through the sign of Capricorn, with time Aries partner could achieve some sort of balanced state in which they are sexually satisfied and their instinctive needs are met. Unfortunately, Capricorn partner will lose their energy and the need to participate in this sort of sexual behavior by that time. This will ultimately lead to their separation, for there is nothing light or easy with these two, especially when it comes to intimate matters.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of the unconscious type of their relationship, they could be insanely attracted to each other, but in most cases their differences will keep them at a safe distance. At their best, Capricorn will support Aries’ libido and control their passion to burn as slowly as possible. At the same time, Aries would consider their partner a teacher and learn about their body and the way to satisfy them. Still, this is a balance that is extremely hard to achieve when the clash of these two hard personalities happens."},"Trust":{"Value":99,"Description":"Since they are both in extremes and “all or nothing” types of people, it will be easy for them to trust each other. Even if they have deep misunderstandings in other areas of their relationship, they will rarely betray each other’s trust. This is something they will easily take for granted though, for when they are together, they seem to lose awareness of the things between them that should be treasured. One of them should have the sense to remind the other from time to time about the qualities that their bond includes."},"Intellect":{"Value":20,"Description":"They should keep their conversation in touch with carrier goals, achievements at work and physical activity, for Capricorn exalts Mars, the ruler of Aries. Other than that, they don’t have much to talk about.\\r\\n\\r\\nRarely will a Capricorn partner allow their impulsive and from their perspective even stupid Aries partner to have their own opinions and value them as useful or practical. Although they will certainly respect their initiative and energy level, the rest of Aries behavior is simply unacceptable in most matters. Since Capricorn has their feet on the ground and is capable to measure the situation rationally, they will hold on to their calm opinion about their partner’s lack of tact and endurance or even of their idiotism. You can imagine how annoying this can be to an Aries, especially if you take into consideration their passionate need to set strong boundaries and be respected in every way possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, Aries will simply have no patience for their Capricorn partner. They will seem boring and as if they only want people in their life to be useful. This will be attributed to their selfishness and lack of emotion and heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth of them will be wrong in a way, for they would need to understand what they both could become if the right person or motivator came along. The problem is they could remain stuck in this pointless ego battle, until they both get so tired that they will hardly think of another relationship ever again."},"Emotions":{"Value":1,"Description":"In this special case it would be best not to call this paragraph “emotions”, but “understanding”. Their problem is in the way they understand each other to begin with. At the beginning of their relationship they will both probably have an image of the other person as someone they could become after some effort is put into their growth. The problem is that no one here wants to change. Their emotions could easily be connected to this first image they’ve had, however unrealistic it might be. So this is exactly what we would call the lack of understanding, because these two could be crazy in love with each other’s false image and crazy persistent to change one another.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir problem really isn’t the lack of emotion to each other (although you could easily contribute their issues to emotional disability considering their Mars/Saturn nature), but the lack of understanding and acceptance of each other. They are often too stubborn and narrow minded to see that there is something different than what fits into their boundaries of possible personal characteristics.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Values":{"Value":60,"Description":"They both value independence, clarity and honesty, and in general their system of values is not what brings problems to their relationship. Mostly they are in sync when it comes to serious view of people they are surrounded with. The problem they have is in their unrealistic expectations founded on the fact that they share some values.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Aries values someone’s ability to endure and push themselves over all possible personal barriers, that doesn’t mean they are ready to become this person, or have the control to be one. Similarly, Capricorn might value speed and focus of some people, but this doesn’t mean they will jeopardize their depth or attention to detail just to be faster, or leave deep psychological needs unattended only to stay focused at some goal."},"Activities":{"Value":40,"Description":"Capricorn sometimes just doesn’t understand why Aries wants to run at 6 in the morning. Aries doesn’t understand why Capricorn would spend all night doing something extremely boring, just to be thorough when it has no value in this particular matter. What Aries doesn’t understand is that studiousness always has its value, as much as Capricorn doesn’t understand the physical need of their body to rest and act on impulse from time to time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey can easily find activities they both like when they include physical movement. They both need to pay attention to their bodies and everyday habits, so it would be good for them to have the same physical activity every day at the same time together. This way they would motivate each other – Aries will lift up Capricorn’s energy and Capricorn would give endurance to their shared efforts. This could do wonders for their entire relationship, for they could understand each other’s natures much better through this sort of basic activity."},"Summary":{"Value":38,"Description":"This is not an easy relationship. None of the partners has any trace of lightness and blissful ignorance. This is why their relationship might seem like a competition to ruin the relationship in the best possible way. It is hard to say who will get out of it a winner, for they will both feel lousy most of the time and be relieved that they finally separated. If they stubbornly decide they love each other too much to let each other go, both of them would probably bang their heads against a wall for years to come.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir only chance of success is unconditional respect and the wideness of their views and expectations. They could truly complement each other, but only in a scenario where they would look for good in one another and highlight each other’s qualities. Unfortunately, the malefic nature of their rulers rarely allows for them to be this positive and acceptance oriented. If they got together, and whatever their story is, they should think about the things they could learn from each other instead of looking for each other’s shortcomings, and always stay out of each other’s business."}},"Aquarius":{"Love":{"Value":65,"Description":"Sexual contact between signs of Aries and Aquarius can be really stressful or extremely exciting. Usually it is both. Their signs go well together in general and they support each other easily, since they both have a lot of energy to follow one another. Still, when it comes to their sexual and intimate relations, they could lack emotion. Aries is a passionate sign with lot of warm, creative emotions. This is a relationship that could bring out their worst nature and simply emphasize that they are a sign ruled by Mars – a cold, unemotional sexual hunter. While this can be really exciting to both of them, it will not be very fulfilling, because they both need to feel loved.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is an excess of masculinity and energy that could lead to very turbulent relations. Their roles are easy to understand with Aries giving energy and stamina to their Aquarius partner, and Aquarius giving crazy ideas and widening horizons of their Aries. This is very fun at the beginning of their relationship, but after a while, it might get tiresome for there are not enough ideas to cover the emotional emptiness they could encounter."},"Trust":{"Value":85,"Description":"Trust is an important issue for Aries and Aquarius can understand that. This doesn’t mean they will be faithful to their Aries partner forever, but they would think it is fair to keep an open relationship and tell them about their indiscretions. Unfortunately, Aries is ruled by Mars and needs to be the only one in the world that their partner ever lays eyes on. This could turn them into an angry, possessive person who obsesses about the movements of their partner.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we are discussing matters of trust between them that don’t include other people, it is safe to say that they don’t have a problem. They both simply don’t understand why they would lie when there are so many interesting truths to discover. They need to be free to speak their mind and accept that they will never avoid conflict, but that it can be used in a constructive way to better understand each other and strengthen their relationship."},"Intellect":{"Value":90,"Description":"Their conversations can be so exciting that many people would like to jump in. Aries is often kind of serious and asks for their boundaries to be respected. Aquarius partner will recognize this, laugh and shake their entire world. It is unimaginable to Aries, always moving straight, for someone to have such an open mind, going back and front, having new revelations every day and never losing energy for new, different topics.\\r\\n\\r\\nAries could find an idol in their Aquarius partner and full-heartedly enter any dialogue because they are excited about what they might discover and how their perspective would change. On the other hand, Aquarius enjoys this role in their partner’s life due to their ego issues with the Sun positioned at this sign. They will share their thoughts with their partner, trying to be as interesting as possible. Aquarius is motivated by their Aries partner and enjoys making tiny jokes at their expense. It is important for Aries not to take things personally when it comes to Aquarius humor and they might have a lot of fun together.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of their strong natures, filled with energy, they could fight most of the time. In most cases, Aquarius will not stand for ridiculous conflicts and will build a brick wall somewhere between them if needed. Still, they usually tear it down at the end of the day, for they cherish each other the way they are after all"},"Emotions":{"Value":40,"Description":"In order for Aquarius to awaken their emotional nature, it usually takes a partner with enough flexibility and patience to get there. We wouldn’t exactly say that Aries is patient, so you can imagine the problem that could appear. From the perspective of an Aries, their partner is cold, distant and has no intention of opening their heart for them. Aquarius sees things differently and tries to stay rational at all times. When Aries starts asking for the show of emotion, the true problem surfaces, for Aquarius might have shown how they feel the entire time, but no one would guess what they were showing."},"Values":{"Value":30,"Description":"Although they can share a great conversation, their values go their separate ways as soon as they touch the subject of freedom. They both value freedom by first impulse. But in time, Aries realizes that they don’t really value freedom that much when they see it at work. In fact, they would often change everything in their lives only to take away the freedom from their Aquarius partner. This is not a conscious need, but Aries can be like a spoiled child wanting things (and people) all for themselves. So with Aquarius changing direction as the wind and never changing their nature, Aries can find themselves truly unhappy for they want someone to share everything with, not only what the wind carries in."},"Activities":{"Value":99,"Description":"Unless Aquarius suggests something truly unacceptable to their Aries partner, they will have an abundance of possibilities when it comes to their shared activities. With so much energy, their only mistake would be to stay at home and not share a chance to get all that energy out of their systems."},"Summary":{"Value":68,"Description":"This is a couple that lacks tenderness. They are not two brutes who let their relationship fade as soon as their passion does, but the distant examining look of Aquarius can take out the emotion out of it. Aries partner needs to be relaxed by their significant other, so they can melt down and show their true, warm emotional nature. In this relationship, they would have a distant partner that basically supports their primal, instinctive nature. Although it is nice to think that the point of each relationship is for partners to accept each other as they are, in this case that would take away every chance for an Aries to grow through togetherness and learn about their emotional nature. This is something they will never be satisfied with.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, every relationship with Aquarius can surprise us as much as any individual Aquarius could. With them as a partner, there is always room for an enlightening scenario that leaves all things to free will. In case they decide to share their lives together, they should have a screaming room they could individually visit once in a while. This would probably do the trick. And about that lack of emotion, they could just put in a lot of physical tenderness to begin with and let things go from there."}},"Pisces":{"Love":{"Value":20,"Description":"Aries and Pisces are two signs that really have trouble connecting. The beginning of all things lies at 0° of Aries and their end at 29° of Pisces. Their connection is like a “little death” making room for all that is new, untamed and inexperienced. It is hard for them to bond, as much as it is hard for all of us to transcend, go beyond our physical body and be one with the Universe. With that said, it is understandable how difficult it is for their sexual natures to accept one another.\\r\\n\\r\\nAries stands for instinctive sex. The sign of Pisces stands for orgasm. Although Aries cares about their orgasm, they will not make an art out of it. Pisces would rather satisfy themselves than be with someone who doesn’t understand the art of orgasms. When they end up together, it can be torture for both, because they just don’t understand what each of them needs. Aries would even have some success in understanding the need for tenderness and physical touch, but what Pisces want is like an unreachable wonderland that no one needs. In fact, they simply don’t understand what it is they need. Aries looks like an inexperienced child to their Pisces partner, and although this can open the door for Pisces to enter this relationship, it does not feel that good when they realize that this is not about to change.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they are both open enough to find their intimate language, their sex life has to be weird and kinky if they want to succeed. Pisces will feel suffocated in anything ordinary and less satisfying than what they know they deserve, while Aries is usually not very interested in sharing emotions all night long and waking up in the afternoon."},"Trust":{"Value":1,"Description":"With Aries holding their head high, their attractive, straightforward attitude and their libido, it is not easy for sensitive Pisces not to pick up those signals emitted all around. This will immediately give effect to the degree of their confidence. It is hard to open up when you don’t trust your partner, so Pisces will stay in their little world for as long as they can, only to avoid being hurt and lied to. Aries will see their partner’s world as a phony, unclear image that there is no need for, and find their Pisces partner shady and unworthy of their trust."},"Intellect":{"Value":70,"Description":"Aries and Pisces could find many things to talk about if they open up for each other’s support and advice. Although they are interested in entirely different things most of the time, they are still connected as neighboring signs and have a way of leaning on each other. Through their relationship they need to learn about their own weaknesses and how to mend them to be complete. It is not exactly as they complete each other, but the effect they have on each other can be like the correct medicine.\\r\\n\\r\\nAries has a tendency not to look behind, question the past, or be too sharp and fast for their relationships. They could also have an ego with a shotgun, waiting for any potential partner to pass by and kill their desire to even think about dating an Aries, let alone be serious about a relationship with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nPisces are sensitive enough to explain to Aries how they should soften up but keep their boundaries strong. Pisces represent a dream land of Aries and they are able to show them that they could actually have a mission and a higher purpose, instead of just chasing through life.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn return, Aries partner will help their Pisces partner find their grounding. They will not be that gentle about it, that is guaranteed, but could be realistic just enough to show Pisces how important it is to have initiative and build something you dream about in the real world. If they start their intimate relationship on these foundations, they could easily discover their middle ground for other segments of their relationship.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn case they are not so open to change and are not in search of someone to help them create, they will hardly share many topics they both find interesting."},"Emotions":{"Value":5,"Description":"Their emotional worlds are like two different planets that rule their signs – Mars and Neptune. While Mars, the ruler of Aries, is covered in rust, a red colored desert with volcanoes, canyons and weather, Neptune is a blue gas giant, cold, whipped by winds and much farther from the Sun. This is exactly how their emotions differ. Those that Aries cherish most are well defined, strong, protected, and colored in a color of passion. Pisces on the other hand, have a windy and changeable emotional world, colored blue like the color of sadness and vision, and are easily cooled down as soon as they feel disappointment."},"Values":{"Value":35,"Description":"It is strange how they both value honesty and have such trust barriers when they get together. When they get involved, trust becomes something like a sole purpose of their entire relationship.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey will also both like fairytale heroes and value the usual pride, chastity and bravery scenario. Still, the core of these values is different for the two of them. Aries representatives will value them because of that sense of strength, power and because of the role of that one and only hero, smarter and braver than everyone else. Pisces value them for their ideals, happy endings and those utopian relationships between those few worthy men and women."},"Activities":{"Value":40,"Description":"They could share a walk in the forest, or engage in water sports. Other activities that Aries would gladly take on are not “spiritual” enough for Pisces. Pisces always need to have “a second perspective” and this can seem crazy to their Aries partner. Yes, Pisces partner knows that sports are healthy, but they need to attach them to something from their infinite world. So water sports are fine, because of all the secrets of the water, the view of the ocean, being underwater and contemplating on the purpose of life, or a dive in the pool. Walk in the forest can be beautiful because they can hear the birds, trees saying “hello” and wait for two owls to rest on their shoulders. In the world of Aries, things are really so much simpler and if they want to enjoy something, they will simply go and enjoy. In the same manner, they would run when they run, practice when they practice and watch the ocean when they watch the ocean."},"Summary":{"Value":29,"Description":"This is a relationship disturbed mostly by the lack of trust and the ability of both parties to open up to their partner. Aries is ruled by Mars, the planet that rules our first chakra, responsible for our ability to set good boundaries. Pisces is ruled by Neptune, in charge of our entire aura and our permeability for outside stimuli. Since they are both responsible for our border with the outside world, it is hard to say which partner should loosen up and make it possible for them to come close. Their only chance of a happy ending is if Aries partner dives in and their Pisces partner wakes up.\\r\\n\\r\\n"}}},"Taurus":{"Aries":{"Love":{"Value":65,"Description":"The fact that Aries is ruled by Mars and Taurus by Venus immediately shows us how sexual these signs are. Both planets are in connection with physical relations, but their biggest difference is in their final goal when it comes to sex.\\r\\n\\r\\nAries in its rough form is guided by a simple instinct, the need for continuation of the species and the transfer of genetic material to the next generation. On the other hand, Taurus is all about satisfaction. They don’t even consider orgasm that big of a deal if they are enjoying themselves through the entire sexual experience. To satisfy Taurus, you need to be emotionally involved, gentle and passionate at the same time, and willing to put some time and effort into the art of sex. Aries representatives usually get satisfied with having sexual relations at all. This goes for both male and female representatives of the sign.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor their mutual satisfaction it is imperative for Aries to develop an atypical sense of touch and work on their sensuality in order to keep their Taurus happy. Let us also remember that Taurus is a fixed sign, pretty much set in their ways, and when it comes to sexual satisfaction they will rarely compromise and settle for less than perfect.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Trust":{"Value":85,"Description":"Both of these signs have the ability to form a stable relationship filled with honesty. Neither of them is flaky or runs away from a good challenge. This can contribute to a positive attitude and open agreements on honesty when they are together. They both have a need to search for their one true love, as Mars and Venus always do. This can lead to infidelity and typical love triangle issues, due to lack of emotion from Aries or a lack of self-worth by Taurus partner. Still, if they communicate well from the beginning, they will usually find how important mutual trust is to both of them and try hard not to jeopardize it"},"Intellect":{"Value":40,"Description":"It is quite obvious that Aries and Taurus both have horns. This is an image you should definitely keep in mind while analyzing their communication skills. Not only are they both stubborn, but they are not even stubborn in a similar way to share some understanding.\\r\\n\\r\\nAries grabs their convictions and simply doesn’t let go. They will kick and scream (literally) until they convince Taurus that they are right about something (consider it the smallest thing in the entire Universe). When Taurus notices this Aries’ behavior, they dig in. They don’t move. Ever. They don’t even possess the sense of sound. You can almost expect a deep voiced “moo” as they get more and more irritated. Their shoulders go up, their eyebrows make an “M” and they simply stand there, annoying their Aries partner even more.\\r\\n\\r\\nWho could be this inhuman to just stand there and not listen to a word their loved one says in that high pitched tone? Taurus can. Not because of the anger, but because they are in fact too sensitive to deal with this kind of behavior. Taurus never looks too sensitive. Their Venus role is grounded and strong, but this is a sign in which the Moon is exalted, Uranus falls and Mars is in detriment. You can imagine how this person can react to shouting and aggression of any kind.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir intellect is not an issue at all. If they can find their way through those hardheaded conflicts, it is all the same if they were intelligent or stupid because they must love each other very much.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cure for this condition is in the middle, of course.

It is safe to assume that as much as they may love each other, it will be difficult for both of them to know they are loved. Although some of the rituals can be taught in time, this is not a solution if they don’t feel enough closeness.\\r\\n\\r\\nAries shows their emotions loudly and openly, in a way that is sort of rough and inpatient. They don’t give much time for the other person to give an emotion back, and act as Fire, their element, without much sense for anyone. Taurus may find this superficial, too intense or even phony, as they don’t recognize this type of behavior as love. Taurus shows their emotions in a silent, slow process of giving. They will show love through cooking, touching and gentle words. The problem is in the fact that Aries finds this boring, stiff or even untrue.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo make each another feel loved, they will both have to learn to show affection to their partner in a way that differs a lot from their natural one. This can be a small or a large obstacle and the outcome depends only on their readiness to listen to the needs of their loved one."},"Values":{"Value":90,"Description":"This is an area in which they match quite well. Although they seem completely different, their main objectives are pretty much the same. They both value material security, since Aries is ruled by Mars, a planet connected to the fear of existential crisis, and Taurus is an Earth sign, material in their core and very inclined to the financial world.

If they don’t lack in primal sexual drive, they will probably build a strong and gentle sexual relationship, in which both of them will have their needs met.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem they might encounter is the possibility that none of them will have enough initiative. Still, they are usually stubborn enough to overcome this small obstacle. Since they share sexual fantasies and ideas about intimacy, with enough openness and communication they should be able to overcome any obstacle they stumble upon.

The partner that is stuck in one place has difficulty to understand why things couldn’t stay the same, forever. It will be very hard to explain to them how much pressure the person making a change must have felt in the first place to understand that change is needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey can be stubborn and closed up for any sort of emotional contact, especially when they get angry or someone hurts them. This is the main reason their communication is not that good at times, for they both have trouble opening up and living in the moment, without the fear of being hurt. The problem here is not the fear itself, other signs can feel it too, but the lack of awareness that this fear even exists. They should practice intimacy and tell each other embarrassing things and emotional issues they wouldn’t share with anyone else, in order to build enough trust and make room for a meaningful dialogue."},"Emotions":{"Value":99,"Description":"The sign of Taurus is an Earth sign in which the Moon, the ruler all of our emotions, is exalted.

Still, in most cases, they will give enough space to one another to set an individual list of priorities and find a compromise if some things are more valuable to one of them, than to the other."},"Activities":{"Value":99,"Description":"Not only will they eat and sleep together, but they will also feel so much joy in the fact that they finally have someone to do these things with, without the sense of guilt. The main problem here is that they could easily neglect the needs of their physical bodies for a healthy lifestyle and activity. There is a lot of self-control needed in order for them to stay together and not get overweight or simply too lazy."},"Summary":{"Value":86,"Description":"The relationship between two Taurus representatives is something to cherish and hold on to, only if they are not both too stubborn in their intent to wait for the other person to make the first move. Because of their emotional and sensual nature, they can be very attentive to each other’s needs and take care of one another when necessary. Their problem usually shows only through the double set of horns, making them sink too deep into their differences with no apparent reason. If they could open up to each other, and to their mutual need for change, this is a relationship both of them would find extraordinary."}},"Gemini":{"Love":{"Value":5,"Description":"Taurus is a sensual Earth sign with a deep need for physical touch and the joy of all senses of the body. Gemini needs intellectual stimulation and doesn’t care that much about spending time in someone’s arms. It is not as if they don’t have the need to be touched, we all do, but they have to know they are loved and accepted in so many different ways and touch is just one of them. After all, they are one of the Air signs and in their world thoughts have to be preoccupied, while strong communication is something that gives the possibility of a good sexual life.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Taurus could stay at home, in bed, all they long, cuddling with their sweetheart and ordering food, Gemini would like to get out and be intimate at all not so intimate places. Their sex life could become the source of most of their problems, as soon as Gemini gets bored or Taurus annoyed by the lack of emotional essence."},"Trust":{"Value":10,"Description":"Trust can be a real issue with this couple. Gemini is not all that trustworthy when someone tries to tie them down. Taurus, in most cases, lives for the day when they will be tied down with someone simultaneously. If they don’t start their relationship on a clear and truthful foundation, where the first thing they learn about each other would be the level of commitment each of them wants, a true problem with trust will easily arise.\\r\\n\\r\\nGemini partner will start thinking of excuses to get out of any obligation imposed on them by Taurus, only to avoid hurting their feelings. In response, Taurus will sense something is wrong and start obsessing about their partner’s behavior and the things they say. This can come to the point of absolute distrust between them, especially if Taurus gets really angry and “vindictive” in their usual passive and stubborn manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nGemini’s intentions are often misinterpreted here and this can lead to a number of following situations that will hurt them both. It is very important for them to discuss into detail what they both wish for while their relationship grows. This way, they could prevent misunderstanding that could lead to an unrepairable lack of trust."},"Intellect":{"Value":60,"Description":"Taurus is a sign that precedes Gemini. In the astrological sense, this tells us that the sign of Gemini wouldn’t exist if Taurus wasn’t there. Basically, this means that Gemini partner wouldn’t do much if their physical needs weren’t taken care of. This is where their relationship has a strong connection, for Gemini partner might need someone like Taurus to take care of their body and its needs.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is very easy for an Air sign such as Gemini to forget to have lunch or sleep for a couple of hours per night. There are so many interesting things in the world that they just don’t want to miss. Taurus partner could cook a healthy meal, take care of their finances and insist on a daily schedule that would give their Gemini a good energetic base to invest in their ideas.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general, their interests are not that similar, but they can find a way to communicate, for none of them lacks gentleness and a way with words. If Gemini partner decides to slow down a little bit and Taurus opens up, they could even find out it is possible for them to have fun together. After all, they are ruled by Venus and Mercury, two inner planets that are, when combined, in charge of fun, sweet talk and the art of conversation."},"Emotions":{"Value":35,"Description":"It is not very likely they will share their emotions with ease and enjoy each other the way they might with some other zodiac representatives. Still, there is a gentle side to Taurus that can melt down even the coldest of hearts. In most cases, their best chance of a loving relationship is in the love Taurus feels. We wouldn’t say that Gemini is insensitive or unemotional, but they certainly have different approach to their emotional nature than the Earth sign of Taurus, that exalts the Moon.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Taurus falls in love with a Gemini, they will do anything to understand their nature. There is nothing that a gentle nature of Taurus can’t understand, however different from their personal primal character it might be. When their Gemini feels this deep and stable understanding, they could respond in a warm and childish way, learning that they can be free even when in love with someone like Taurus.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Values":{"Value":1,"Description":"While Taurus values the Earth, the material world, their emotions and what is stable in their life, Gemini values the Universe, the world of ideas, their rational mind and change. This is where their differences and element natures strongly diverge. They should really try hard to accept the true value of both their worlds in order to work out their differences.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Activities":{"Value":25,"Description":"They could find activities to enjoy together, but not at the same pace. Gemini likes things fast, while exciting, and Taurus would like to examine everything from the beginning to the end, set the value on each activity and thoroughly decide if they would want to repeat it or not. This will drive their Gemini crazy. It is best for both of them to walk, a lot, for this can keep Gemini grounded, while Taurus always needs movement not to end up in a static, inert, horizontal state. They could connect their passionate natures through some kind of art, especially if they managed to find a way to create something together. With Gemini’s ideas and Taurus’ practical sense, combined with the need for beauty, this should be a true work of art."},"Summary":{"Value":23,"Description":"The relationship between Taurus and Gemini doesn’t give much promise to begin with. Still, the fixed quality of the sign of Taurus can give them enough endurance and persistence to last in their intent to be with a Gemini, long enough for them to really get to know each other well. Although their chances to reconcile their differences are slim, if Taurus partner puts their whole heart into it, they might manage to become the most relevant part of their Gemini’s life as their base and their reliability in everything they do. In case they accept each other completely, Taurus will give Gemini their connection to planet Earth, to their body and their daily routine, giving them the base for health and normal functioning. In return, Gemini will give their Taurus wings and, better yet, teach them how to fly."}},"Cancer":{"Love":{"Value":95,"Description":"Someone might think that Taurus and Cancer are two of the most asexual signs in the entire zodiac. This is an instinctive assumption based on the fact that both signs don’t care for Mars very much, meaning they don’t care for instinctive sex. They would probably never have the urge to have sex just for the sake of it, but this doesn’t in any case mean they are asexual.\\r\\n\\r\\nTaurus is a sign of physical pleasure. Ruled by Venus, the planet of feminine sexuality, Taurus needs to approach their sexual experiences with the same studiousness with which they would approach any other thing in their life. They need to see, touch, smell, feel everything on their partner’s body and enjoy making them satisfied. With Cancer’s need for closeness and the lack of ability to make their sexual life light and carefree, Taurus seems to have the perfect touch to relax them and build trust within their sexual relationship.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the lack of Mars comes the lack of initiative, and this could be their problem when it comes to sex. In case they both don’t have a sexual drive stronger than their love for food, they could end up in an asexual relationship, in which they would lie around the house, cook, eat and gain weight all day long."},"Trust":{"Value":99,"Description":"When Taurus and Cancer fall in love with each other, they base their entire relationship on the feel of their partner. There is not much that can be hidden from this sensitive, “sixth” sense these two can share when they connect. It would take a lot to break their trust and this would certainly mean the end of their relationship. In most situations, none of them has the need to betray their partner, for their goal is the same – love, family and home.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Intellect":{"Value":80,"Description":"They share lots of different interests and will easily talk about their relationship. Neither of these signs talks much, but they are perfectly capable of understanding each other’s silence and give each word a lot of significance. Their most common topics would include love, home and children, except when they feel unready or when they are too young. It is important to understand that these are not the only issues on their minds, though. Whatever their current interests, they will communicate it in a slow, sensitive manner, leading a conversation to a point of deep mutual understanding.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, Taurus can be truly stubborn at times. It doesn’t really matter if they are right or not, for they simply close up for any further conversation as soon as one of their true convictions is touched. Cancer can’t really do that much when this happens. They can try and be even more gentle and compassionate. In case they are close to enlightened, this will certainly work. If not, they will get really emotional and discover that their Taurus partner in fact drives them crazy. As a result, Taurus will see their partner as a real lunatic, waving their hands for no reason and showing no rational behavior whatsoever."},"Emotions":{"Value":99,"Description":"Taurus and Cancer are the rulers of the entire warm, earthly emotional world. It is not just due to their sensitivity, but the combination of their emotional expression is something almost unimaginable. While Cancer feels, senses and takes care of their Taurus partner in the emotional realm, Taurus will give love back through physical tenderness, material security and the gentle touch of practical sense that Cancer needs. When this cycle happens several times, their love seems like a chain reaction that will never stop growing.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they meet in supporting circumstances, when they don’t need to fight for each other or the possibility of their love, every emotion should simply build up on the previous one and things between them should run smoothly. But if they stumble upon an obstacle of any kind, before their love for each other develops, they will probably be discouraged and never discover what they might have felt if only they fought for one another. If they do fall in love, they will not lack the energy to fight for their relationship, no matter the obstacles.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Values":{"Value":80,"Description":"Most of all, they both value life and peace. Since the Moon is the ruler of the sign of Cancer and exalted in Taurus, they both deeply value all things the Moon represents – family, compassion, understanding and bliss.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, there can be a certain divergence in their view of the material world. Cancer is a Water sign, much more focused on the value of emotion, while Taurus will be turned to financial security. This usually reflects the fear Taurus feels when it comes to their material existence being in question. In the eyes of Cancer this may seem superficial for they have a tendency to think of material reality in an idealistic way. If they have a family together, these issues should settle, because the love of Cancer partner to their children combined with their desire to give them everything they need, easily shifts their perspective and teaches them about the true value of money.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Activities":{"Value":90,"Description":"We could say that they might share every single activity any of them thinks of, but this is not that often called an “activity”. Most of the time and especially if they both have demanding jobs, they will simply share the activity of sleeping, eating or doing nothing. This is not a question of laziness, but more of an exaggerated need for the pleasure of rest. When shared, it seems to multiply and grow beyond both of their rational minds."},"Summary":{"Value":91,"Description":"Taurus and Cancer present the gentlest couple of the zodiac. When they fall in love, they will rarely find the reason to separate, because of their shared emotional goals for love, understanding, family and the feeling of home. This is the relationship that seems like a perpetuum mobile of love, in case both partners don’t already have too much emotional baggage that makes them unable to give and receive this depth of emotion. Even if they do, with no obstacles on the way, they will likely learn to forgive and forget as the flow of their relationship takes them to what they always desired.\\r\\n\\r\\n"}},"Leo":{"Love":{"Value":50,"Description":"The sexual relationship between a Taurus and a Leo can be in a way exhausting for both of them. This is mostly due to the fact that they can both be lazy. While Taurus likes to lie down and enjoy being loved, Leo likes to lie down and be served and taken care of. It is in the nature of both signs to spend time in a horizontal position and it might be hard for them to agree on who is to be on top. When motivated, they can both be excellent lovers that put a lot of energy into their sexual activities, but with one another, their sex life will most likely become a battle for personal satisfaction and rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir best possibility of a healthy sex life would be the one where both partners have already built their sexual identity and know how to satisfy themselves. In this case, sensual Taurus would take care of their Leo partner, while passionate Leo would bring excitement into their relationship. In this scenario they would both take care of their own personal needs, aware that they need to commit to their partner’s satisfaction in order for a relationship to work.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general, they are a feminine and a masculine sign, and share a similar need for personal satisfaction. If they don’t end up in a clinch in which they both have expectations and won’t move until they are met, they could have a very rewarding sex life. After all, they are just two different sides of love, joy and life in color."},"Trust":{"Value":60,"Description":"As two fixed signs, they are most likely to stand on their own two feet when it comes to telling the truth. They understand that honesty is the base of any relationship that might last, and if they fall in love, none of them will want to jeopardize their future together. If, however, one of them has a habit to lie or cheat that they have developed in their previous relationships, they will probably continue the same behavior in this one. It is of outmost importance that both of them develop their personalities and moral boundaries independently in order for them to be functional together.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir main problem could be the lack of will on any side to change behavioral patterns that might arise. In case one of them believes that the other one could change, time could consume them through a sense of distrust that builds with disappointment because change doesn’t occur."},"Intellect":{"Value":5,"Description":"They are in luck because they are ruled by Venus and the Sun, both warm and with a tendency to be close to one another, because when it comes to their interests and their intellectual understanding, they could drive each other out of their minds. It is hard to say who will be more annoying to whom. While Taurus holds on to their practical perspective, Leo holds on to their ego, and a conflict with no solution is born. Their fixed natures will make them hold on to their “side” however stupid it might be, with no actual intent of reconciliation. They both need someone with a not so rigid approach if they want to find the middle ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nTaurus will find a mutual language with Leo through their usual, materializing role. Any creative impulse of Leo could be followed by the realization plan thought out by their Taurus partner, if only they shared enough emotions to have patience for each other. Their creative strength is the strength of a Venus in combination with Sun, so we could say with certainty that they would create something in image of universal love."},"Emotions":{"Value":20,"Description":"Taurus is a deeply emotional sign, in case they don’t close up and live in their own little, safe material world. Leo is a passionate sign that represents love as a power of creation and all we feel gravity toward. They are both a personification of love, each one of them in their own way. When they get together, they will rarely feel this love for one another. Maybe we could view this as their mission to give love to the less fortunate zodiacal signs, or maybe their emotional nature has to give more and receive less. Whatever the reason in most cases they simply don’t fall in love with each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a great possibility that they will simply stay in their own worlds, with no prospects of merging even in something close to a friendship. This is not because they don’t like each other or feel some sort of hostility, but because they are like two islands in two different oceans. Each of them has their own nature, their own world with all its beauties, and they need someone closer to this world they hold on to. None of them has the role of a floating island in search for someone to merge with.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf emotions are shared, they could be huge, but there would still be the issue of showing and recognizing them before we imagine a fairytale."},"Values":{"Value":1,"Description":"Taurus and Leo have different views on value itself. While Taurus values financial security and material beauty, Leo values everything shiny, bravery and someone’s inner fire. There is a peace to Taurus that Leo doesn’t want to understand, for it seems like a boring place to visit. Leo values peace, too, but for them it is hidden in a different, much more joyful place or in public, such as peace between entire countries and continents. To Taurus, Leo may seem like someone to strike a pose and have no depth at all, and although depth is not one of their primary values, it is still a very important one. They find nothing interesting in people without essence and neither does Leo, thinking of Taurus and how they don’t open up to share anything deep.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Activities":{"Value":40,"Description":"Shared activities are very easy for both of them to find. Either they will lie down, sleep, eat and cuddle, or they will separate and do things without each other. Taurus is inert and loves to spend time on their couch while the rain outside falls and they hear nothing but the sound of a fireplace. Leo is guided by their nature, and a lion does sleep for 20 hours a day and plays for the rest of it. Even the fiercest of lions wait for their lioness to serve their food. The problem will occur when Taurus sets up a romantic image and Leo falls asleep, but this is still a scenario that could work.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir outside activities can be fun for both of them if they go out to fancy restaurants. This is where Leo can be seen, and act as a gallant person that deserves the best, while Taurus could enjoy really good food. Other than these, they probably won’t have that many activities to share, but if they are not stubborn, they could enjoy everything that is not too demanding and physical together."},"Summary":{"Value":29,"Description":"The relationship of Taurus and Leo could be aggressively challenging if not for their warm natures ruled by Venus and the Sun. Although they are both signs of fixed quality with entirely different natures, if they gather enough patience before they enter their relationship, they have a chance to become your archetypal couple of a girl and a boy. When their masculine and feminine principles are in balance, they can use them to mend their sexual, intellectual and financial circumstances and really enjoy each other."}},"Virgo":{"Love":{"Value":85,"Description":"The sexual relationship between a Taurus and a Virgo can be quite touching. Virgo partner is usually ashamed to show their sexuality, or their body for that matter. This is where Taurus gets in the picture as a hero setting their Virgo free. The gift of Taurus is their ability to relax their sexual partner by giving them enough attention and obsessing about their satisfaction. To their Virgo partner this seems almost unreal, for they would expect something rough and scary when it comes to sex. This is an ideal combination of partners for first sexual experiences, because Virgo can enter the world of sexuality in the gentlest way possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem here can arise because of the nature of Virgo and their need to go into detail and analyze everything. Not only can they damage the spontaneity of their sex life, but they could also affect their Taurus’ self-esteem by finding little flaws on their body and in their actions.\\r\\n\\r\\nVirgo is a sign of virginity and is a place where Venus, representing all satisfaction, falls. The fear of being hurt is sometimes too big to handle and with Virgo’s view of Venus they rarely understand the side of sexuality that is in relation to satisfaction and tenderness. Taurus is a sign ruled by Venus and their understanding of sex is quite different. They seem to have a mission to explain what tenderness is to those around them, and find someone like Virgo a perfect student for their teachings. They will gladly explain to their partner what the beautiful side of sex is, only if Virgo is ready to listen."},"Trust":{"Value":75,"Description":"Virgo doesn’t trust anyone with ease. This is due to the fact that Pisces are their opposing sign, and they see every partner in their life as a glimpse of the unknown. It is not easy to open up to such an enormous field of possibility when you feel so small.\\r\\n\\r\\nTaurus is much more relaxed and gives so much importance to the beauty of sex, so if Virgo doesn’t feel adequate with their Taurus partner, it will not be easy for them to believe in their honesty or faithfulness. This mistrust will really hurt their Taurus partner, for they can’t understand what they did to deserve it and they will probably blame it on Virgo’s changeable nature, thinking that they are not that honest, either."},"Intellect":{"Value":90,"Description":"Intellectual strength of Virgo is exactly what Taurus needs to build a better understanding of the world. It is often said that Taurus can be really stubborn and difficult to talk to, but it is almost certain that a Virgo will use their mutable quality to find different approaches in order to explain their point of view. As two Earth signs, they can both stick to their convictions and be too rigid not to accept another’s point of view, but in most cases, the intellect of Virgo and the tenderness of Taurus can help them find a language they both understand whatever the situation.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Emotions":{"Value":85,"Description":"The patience Taurus can have when they fall in love is what makes them such a good fit for Virgo. Since Virgo will not recognize their feelings right away, they will need time to set a strong emotional foundation. Because of the lack of trust and disappointment Virgo is almost always ready for, Taurus needs to stay put and never let them down in order to build the trust and let their feelings for each other evolve.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they are not both too stiff and too afraid to get hurt, they can build a strong and deep emotional relationship with mutual respect intact. It is really important not to stay at a safe distance for too long, because they could easily build a relationship with no emotion and stay in it, unsatisfied, for years, even though they might have had potential to fall madly in love."},"Values":{"Value":50,"Description":"They don’t exactly value the same things, but they will be okay for as long as the feminine side of Taurus isn’t disrespected. With Taurus’ ruler in fall at the sign of Virgo, their Earth to Earth understanding is a bit damaged. Since Venus represents all value, Virgo could show what Taurus would recognize as a lack of understanding in general. However, they will both value the nature of Earth element, stable, secure and slow, and this should give them enough time to mend the differences and find middle ground."},"Activities":{"Value":55,"Description":"Taurus can truly seem lazy to their Virgo partner, especially when they are on a satisfaction spree and don’t leave the house except if they are on their way to a nice restaurant. The intimacy of their nature scares Virgo to the point of agony and they will quickly need a change of scenery not to feel like they are standing in one place for eternity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Taurus approaches their usual activities in a way to respect Virgo’s occasional obsession with their health, they could think of a number of things to do together, and complement each other very well. The preparation of healthy snacks would be just one of possible suggestions to satisfy the needs they both have.\\r\\n\\r\\nVirgo is a sign ruled by Mercury, and although it belongs to the element of Earth, they need to move. Taurus can be really static and it is important that they make a decision to follow their partner or they really won’t have much of a future together. It is a good thing that Taurus is usually guided by inertia, so when they get used to movement, this will become a permanent state for both of them. Although you wouldn’t connect these signs to travelling, when together, they could feel and follow the urge to travel the world."},"Summary":{"Value":73,"Description":"In general, Taurus is there to teach Virgo about love, tenderness and sexuality. Virgo needs to be flexible enough to value their Taurus and give them the intellectual view on things they might idealize. Their relationship could be a match made in heaven, only if they are not too scared of being hurt and too distrustful. If they do give in to each other and fall madly in love, they could be the combination of a clear heart, represented by Taurus, and a clear mind, represented by Virgo. What more would they need than each other?"}},"Libra":{"Love":{"Value":35,"Description":"The relationship between Taurus and Libra has a special kick to it, since both signs are ruled by Venus, but represent its completely different characteristics. While Taurus loves to be comfortable and relies on their sense of touch and taste, Libra will want everything pretty and rely on their eyesight and the sense of smell. They do connect in a way, but in most cases they have this different approach to Venus as a planet of sexual pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main difference between these signs is in their exalting planet. Taurus exalts the Moon and Libra exalts Saturn. It is like they adore opposite things and while Taurus will care for emotions and tenderness in a sexual relationship, Libra will rely on its depth and good timing. It will not be easy for them to understand what the other person wants and they could both end up seeming needy to one another – Taurus to Libra because of their emotional neediness and Libra to Taurus because of their physical one.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever different they might be, they are still two signs ruled by Venus and can be fairly attracted to each other. As a feminine and a masculine sign, they could mend their differences and try to learn about “the other side of Venus” instead of expecting the impossible from one another. They are both gentle lovers who like their relationships without stress and drama, so with enough patience they could be a really good fit."},"Trust":{"Value":30,"Description":"Taurus’ trust can be damaged with Libra’s need to be liked by everyone, especially if they are not sure if they want to be with their Taurus partner in the first place. If Libra can’t make this basic decision, the uncertainty would be a punch for the ego of Taurus and it will be very hard to recover after they realize they are not wanted with certainty.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven if they are Libra’s first choice, there is still a matter of flirting with so many other people. With really insecure Libra specimens, it is almost impossible to have a trusting relationship, for their need for acceptance can go a long way and even suck them into unfaithfulness. Their quality however, is in their outlook on justice, and they will rarely act on their insecurities, but still, who could be sure when the vibe is so unstable, especially when someone as stable as Taurus tries to blend in.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Intellect":{"Value":5,"Description":"These two will drive each other crazy. On one hand you would have Taurus, never doubting their character, never moving and annoyingly unchangeable. On the other, you would have Libra, indecisive and never certain of what they want. It seems impossible for them not to jump on each other’s nerves daily.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main challenge here is their primary opinion on each other. As two sides of Venus, these signs represent a peasant girl (Taurus) and a city lady (Libra). When you combine this with the fact that Libra has a fallen Sun, their ego problem would easily make them feed on their refined, city image and they could criticize the “peasant girl” for her lack of style and her rusticity. They simply don’t understand that the fact that Taurus likes things comfortable doesn’t always reflect on their lack of style and can’t accept the differences in their appearance.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou could say that this is quite superficial, but it is actually a really deep problem with insecurity. Libra is not criticizing Taurus because they are such a fine person, but because they are afraid they are not. Taurus will easily get insecure because of this critical view and dip into their guilt trip, almost as if they always searched for someone to wake the guilt in them, but without the ability to change and accept criticism as constructive. Even if this is not something any of them will say out loud, it can be felt in their relationship, even by those around them."},"Emotions":{"Value":25,"Description":"If they are attracted to each other just enough they could fall crazy in love, but in most cases, they are both too careful to end up in a loving relationship. Although Taurus and Libra both are looking for someone to sweep them off their feet, they will rarely have this with each other. Taurus will usually decide not to give enough space for Libra to discover them, while Libra will spend too much time looking for faults. As signs ruled by Venus, they are both complemented by signs ruled by Mars and normally look for a partner with initiative, to have a fast, exciting start and not get enough time to think things over."},"Values":{"Value":40,"Description":"Venus, their ruler, represents value itself, so we could say that they value same things because of the similarities shown through what their ruler likes or not, but in different ways. Of course they both want true, magical, mystical love with Venus exalted in Pisces, but Taurus values tenderness and touch on their way to get there, while Libra values responsibility and seriousness. However, their final goals are the same and they do value one’s ability to love them, most of all. This could be their real point of connection if they do fall in love with one another.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Activities":{"Value":65,"Description":"It is not hard to find activities to share for this couple, for as long as they are not boring to one of them. Although Taurus doesn’t really have to go to matinees and art shows with no soul, they could have a nice time at a cozy art gallery where art work in warm colors is exhibited. Libra will rarely go for a walk in the mud, but they could make a tour downtown, where they could both be seen wearing their new outfits. With their mutual love for beautiful things and love in general, they will find a nice way to spend their time together if they are open enough to make some changes to their usual routine."},"Summary":{"Value":33,"Description":"Look out Libras, for Taurus is here to wake your inner fears and bring them all to surface! Taurus should be careful, too, for their need to feel guilt could blossom with a Libra. This relationship is a lesson both of them will never forget, especially if they manage to build enough understanding and tenderness between them. The only way they could ever be happy would be to embrace what they don’t want to deal with in their"}},"Scorpio":{"Love":{"Value":95,"Description":"As all opposing signs, Taurus and Scorpio can be madly attracted to each other, more so because of the sexual nature of their signs. We wouldn’t primarily link Taurus to sexuality, but it does represent sensuality and is a sign that governs physical pleasure. Their relationship is a connection of deepest emotions and sexuality that no other couple in the zodiac is privileged to have.\\r\\n\\r\\nAny sort of sexual frustration could lead to a pretty dark approach to their sex life. Scorpio has this depressive need to die naked and sweaty in the arms of a loved one, while Taurus has the need to be loved this much. It may even sound romantic, but carries with it all unsolved emotional issues as baggage into their sexual encounters. This doesn’t mean their sex life will be bad. On the contrary, they will both find it fantastic, because they will fill it with all sorts of emotions, good or bad. In the end, emotion will be the only thing that is left and sex will be a way to connect rather than a means to personal satisfaction. This can become an obsession and even an addiction, but who would give up on the opportunity of such deep intimacy?\\r\\n\\r\\nAs signs of fixed quality, when they click, it is impossible to separate them, and no one would want to when you consider the possible vengeance of Scorpio. They represent the basic contact between sexual planets Venus and Mars, while being from the physical and emotional realms as an Earth and a Water sign. They are the signification of a deeply intimate relationship and a very rich sex life, for as long as Scorpio is tender enough and Taurus ready to experiment."},"Trust":{"Value":80,"Description":"Scorpio rarely trusts anyone but themselves unconditionally and in a relationship with Taurus they need to build the sense of security. We wouldn’t exactly say that Scorpio is insecure, but their deep emotional nature makes them question everyone’s motives in caution not to get hurt.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a fine line between two possibilities in a relationship of Taurus and Scorpio. The first possibility would be the one in which Taurus partner is really closed up, unreachable and too quiet. This could wake the suspicious nature of Scorpio and their obsessive interrogations will damage their mutual trust even more then they lacked it in the first place. The second option would be for Taurus partner to be open just enough to share what Scorpio needs to hear.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they manage to find this fine balance, they shouldn’t have a problem. As they get more and more intimate, Taurus will feel secure enough to share everything Scorpio wants to know and Scorpio will realize that their stable and unchangeable Taurus won’t disappoint them."},"Intellect":{"Value":75,"Description":"As all opposing signs, they seem completely different and as if they have nothing in common. Still, we should keep in mind that opposing signs complement each other perfectly and their communication should be exciting, challenging and something to enjoy if they are both confident enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Scorpio would go in depth about all those things Taurus doesn’t seem to care about, they could be very surprised to find that behind the tender and alive nature of Taurus, there is a deep understanding of everything natural going on, however dark it might seem. In return, Scorpio will show Taurus the value of life from their perspective. Taurus will find it incredible how Scorpio as a sign of death and destruction, can understand the depth of life and emotion better than any other sign in the zodiac."},"Emotions":{"Value":99,"Description":"This emotional connection is really something to deserve. Not only do these two represent the axis of Moon’s special dignities, exalted in Taurus and fallen in Scorpio, but they also have Venus as a ruler on one hand and the intense element of Water on the other. When they fall in love, they become an image of eternal love. There is no better personification of Had, the god of the underworld in ancient Greece, and Persephone – an idea of immortal love that can never die."},"Values":{"Value":99,"Description":"They value life and love in a way that no other sign understands. The depth of their belief system goes as far as planet Earth’s core and if they begin their relationship on the same page, this could be what binds them for years. Although their perspectives differ when it comes to material and emotional values, their core is the same and everything else can be adjusted."},"Activities":{"Value":85,"Description":"Although Scorpio is a sign of change, this doesn’t mean they are not very slow in their everyday routine. As a fixed sign, they are, as much as Taurus, static and inert. There is a lot of energy to Scorpio, nuclear energy lies within their sign, but when it comes to everyday life, they tend to repeat patterns and blend in what mostly other people find “normal”. They do however need new, exciting and breathtaking experiences from time to time, but they would be ok having them alone if their Taurus partner wasn’t interested.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf all possible activities, they will mostly share sexual ones and all experiences of physical pleasure. They will both enjoy discovering how far their sexual desire could lead and this will keep them busy most of the time.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Summary":{"Value":89,"Description":"Taurus and Scorpio are both signs of deepest physical pleasure, each in their own way. This has to be the focus of their relationship, for they can’t seem to understand platonic and imaginative relationships when they get together. There is no such thing as a platonic experience of romance, when the whole point of romance is to get physical. It is very possible that they will build their sexual life to the point where no other partner could ever satisfy their needs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis could lead to a possessive relationship with no way out, although they probably wouldn’t want to get out even if they could. The entire experience can be too dark for the Taurus partner, especially if their practical sense is challenged by Scorpio’s character. In case they are both independent and ready to blend with someone else, they could be the perfect connection between sexual and emotional, the one that we all wish for."}},"Sagittarius":{"Love":{"Value":25,"Description":"When Taurus thinks of sexuality, Sagittarius is probably the last person on their mind. With their childish attitude that changes with the weather, there seems to be no room for any sexual activity in their life. Although this is a delusion, these signs are too far apart in their basic character to understand each other’s sexuality. Sagittarius would probably think of Taurus as a person who eats and sleeps all day long. There is nothing sexual about it, right?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is interesting though, how two people ruled by two beneficent planets such as Venus and Jupiter can’t seem to find sexual satisfaction. The fact is – they can. Although this is a rare scenario, they could actually use their attributes to enhance sexual pleasure Venus would offer. If they understood each other as two individuals who deserve respect, they could find the missing link for a very interesting and fulfilling sex life. Taurus would take care of their Sagittarius partner and keep them satisfied. In return they would get a cheerful soul who knows how to make their relationship exciting. There is so much to be learned about the “light side” of sexuality here, and this could be a fun experience if Taurus loosened up a little and Sagittarius slowed down."},"Trust":{"Value":5,"Description":"The sign of Sagittarius is considered something like a synonym for honesty. It is true that representatives of this sign have no idea how to make up a lie, let alone tell it. Still, when it comes to romantic relationships, they often suffer from a Don Juan syndrome and can’t get enough attention from one partner. Taurus finds this repulsive at best, and if a relationship with a Sagittarius partner begins and they start acting this way, there is a big chance they will get dumped.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrust between these partners isn’t something to be questioned and analyzed. If they do trust each other they can have a wonderful, trusting relationship for a while, but there is still no guarantee on how long this could last. If they don’t, it won’t be mended whatever they try to do. Usually loss of trust here simply breaks up the relationship and they both go their separate ways with no regret."},"Intellect":{"Value":50,"Description":"There are so many beautiful things in the world, and so much to talk about when you think about them. Taurus and Sagittarius both have this joy about them that can be awaken by their relationship. With the Moon exalted in Taurus and Jupiter exalted in Cancer (ruled by the Moon), there is a certain feel, a soul, a tenderness to share between them. Their approaches to life are different, their characters incomparable, but the joy they can feel toward some things is completely the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they don’t find this shared feeling of joy, they could both learn what bad communication really is. In most cases they can talk about the weather and be fine, but when they have a problem, this turns into a ridiculous conversation that isn’t really a conversation at all. Sagittarius will want to jump out of their skin while waiting for Taurus to finish the sentence, as much as Taurus will look at their Sagittarius partner as a source of all stupidity.\\r\\n\\r\\nTaurus is your countryside and Sagittarius is the world, so their problems could easily include disrespect because of their origin or their goals. Although they will rarely end up in a fight or use ugly words, it can sometimes be too obvious how much they don’t care for each other’s worlds and how far apart they really are."},"Emotions":{"Value":25,"Description":"They are both connected with the Moon in a way, so there are some feelings to be shared. However, Sagittarius doesn’t normally react with much emotion to static, from their perspective boring Taurus nature. If Taurus was a bit more prone to temporary infatuations or platonic relationships, they could fall in love with a Sagittarius enough to overcome the differences between them. Sagittarius on the other hand, is often infatuated and temporarily in love. There is a great chance they will fall in love with a Taurus if they like their physical appearances, but they won’t last in those feelings for long enough to gently lead Taurus to mutual love.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir pace is off and they rarely get in sync with their emotions. Most relationships between a Taurus and a Sagittarius partner that manage to last, are those that started as a friendship and had a chance to develop emotionally for years without them actually being in a romantic relationship."},"Values":{"Value":60,"Description":"The combination of signs of Taurus and Sagittarius is a “flower child” full of love, understanding for the world and ultimately humane. They could support each other’s utopian worlds a bit too passionately, and this could lead to one of them, or both, being in a delusion about what reality is about. There is too much love and happiness in the world if they start sharing opinions and this can become like a drug to both of them. The practicality of Taurus will usually break this pattern and hit a counter-attack with their reality checks and material issues so they can both remember where their values part ways – to security and utter lack of it."},"Activities":{"Value":20,"Description":"Food. That is mostly what they both would share. Taurus might not actually share food with joy, but they will certainly like to share the activity of eating. It could be quite easy for them to find other things to do together, too. The problem will surface the moment Taurus wants to go home and spend an evening in their warm bed, while Sagittarius’ fun has just begun. They don’t share the same passion toward the same things, and although they might have fun being together, their priorities are not the same. The Fire energy of Sagittarius will be put off by Taurus’ Earth personality and this will be tedious for both of them."},"Summary":{"Value":31,"Description":"With their inner beauty and the understanding they share in search of the truth to life, these two might seem as a perfect couple. However, every positive needs a negative to complete it, and when we really observe, we can notice that often a Taurus and a Sagittarius don’t even get attracted to each other. Taurus needs earthly pleasures in their relationships and as a fixed, Earth sign it is the slowest of all signs. This is not exactly someone who can easily understand the fast, changeable and fiery Sagittarius.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best possible scenario for their relationship would be for them to get to know each other very well and build a friendship without expectations, for years. In the end, this could result in deep understanding that would provide them both with enough patience to actually start a relationship that has a future. If not, they can always hold on to beauty in the world. Imagine how wonderful their world of creation could be if they joined their forces of good."}},"Capricorn":{"Love":{"Value":85,"Description":"Taurus and Capricorn can both be quite rigid when it comes to sex. This is exactly what could make them a perfect couple. In combination with other signs of the zodiac it can be hard for them to open up and feel the need to experiment, even though Capricorn will do their best to show how ingenious they are when it comes to sex. When they get together and get to know each other intimately, they will learn what it means to relax. Capricorn won’t feel the need to show off and Taurus will let go of their fear of getting hurt.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem in their relationship can be hidden in their understanding of the Moon, for Taurus exalts it, and Capricorn doesn’t like it very much. They could have trouble connecting on an emotional level if Capricorn doesn’t fall in love deeply enough or has trust issues. This will be multiplied by Taurus’ need to be loved unconditionally that they show in an endless loop, scaring their Capricorn away.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir different approaches to the combination of sexual instincts and love are what could make a gap between them. Taurus has a problem with initiative and aggression, not understanding Mars that well, while Capricorn needs initiative, physical strength and supports Mars. In their sex life, this could lead to a lack of emotion from Capricorn partner, leading to the frustration of Taurus, scared away by their libido with no emotional foundation. This could go as far as impotence and a general lack of sexual desire in both partners, unless they hold on to intimate nature of their sexuality and approach each other as different individuals with certain needs."},"Trust":{"Value":99,"Description":"Capricorn just isn’t into lying. They don’t even judge it but find it unnecessary and stupid. Even when they do tell a lie, in most cases it is an experiment with other human beings to see if they can guess where the truth lies. When they are intimately involved, they like things between them and their partner clean and true. Taurus can easily sense this and will feel secure enough to not give in to their occasional need to hide things from their partner. Taurus is ruled by Venus, a planet exalted in the sign of Pisces, so they have this understanding of importance of secrecy when they are in love. With Capricorn, they can find a way to hide their intimacy from the rest of the world and stay true to their loved one for a very, very long time."},"Intellect":{"Value":85,"Description":"Although they have different natures, they understand each other very well and motivate each other to grow – each of them in their needed direction. Their differences are exactly there to make them a perfect couple, because they complement each other in a more subtle way then their opposing signs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe deep understanding of the Moon is something Taurus is blessed with and Capricorn lacks in their core. The fear of emotion can easily become a daily routine of neglect toward their personal emotional needs. Taurus has a mission to teach Capricorn about the significance of tenderness one should always have for one self. In return, Capricorn will help Taurus deal with responsibility and teach them how to reach their goals with no distracting emotions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not always easy for them to understand each other, but with enough compassion and openness to feel for the other person, they can support each other in a way no other pair of signs can. After all, they do belong to the element of Earth, and can make magic in our material reality when they reconcile their differences."},"Emotions":{"Value":90,"Description":"It is difficult to say with certainty they will find emotional fulfillment with each other because they are both very careful when it comes to love. This is usually something like a pattern to be broken when they do begin a relationship, for they have enough time and patience for one another. From the perspective of Taurus, this might not be the best emotional contact they’ve ever had, but from Capricorn’s perspective, things can’t get much better than being loved by a Taurus partner.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, there is a dose of almost unbearable satisfaction Taurus will feel when their long-term digging reaches the emotional core of their Capricorn partner. When this contact is reached, they will rarely feel the need to separate from them again. To Capricorn this may seem as if someone literally touched their heart and they will probably never want to let their Taurus partner go.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Values":{"Value":90,"Description":"With shared sense for value of the material world, these two can get really far together. While Taurus would create and motivate, Capricorn would lead the way to success and financial security. Whatever their goals, they could easily reach them together due to the fact they share the same material values to begin with. Still, they don’t have such a peachy situation when it comes to their approach to emotions and family. They should observe different sides of their personalities as complementing instead of destructive and find a way to coexist giving value to each other’s shadow.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Activities":{"Value":85,"Description":"You could say that Taurus is lazy and Capricorn never stops working, but this is not exactly the case. If any sign in the zodiac needs rest, it would be Capricorn. Their high ambition can lead them to a state of low energy and Taurus is there to mend their tired Soul with fine food and time for joy. On the other hand, if the creative, motivating side of Taurus is awaken by the striving nature of their Capricorn partner, they will become everything but lazy and make room for both of them to be satisfied and happy with what they’ve accomplished. In short, they can do anything together, for as long as they hold on to a fine balance of activity and rest.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Summary":{"Value":89,"Description":"Taurus and Capricorn can form a relationship so deep that their creative power in the material realm could seem unreachable for other signs of the zodiac. With the ability to complement each other in a gentle, slow way, they are the most boring couple on the outside, with most exciting inner activity that stays hidden from the rest of the world. If Taurus motivates their Capricorn partner, and Capricorn shows the way of accomplishment to their Taurus partner, they could work together, raise children and share a life with more fun than they are both used to, or simply form an unbreakable bond. When their deep emotions intertwine, they are bound to each other for eternity."}},"Aquarius":{"Love":{"Value":15,"Description":"\\r\\nThe slow, tender and smooth nature of Taurus will be ridiculously annoyed by the changeable and unusual nature of Aquarius. In most cases, they are not even attracted to each other and think of each other as boring or crazy, depending on the situation. However, they could really help each other blossom if they opened up for the possibility of unusual sexual encounters.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the tenderness of Taurus is projected on their independent, distant Aquarius partner, their creative and motivating side would awake, giving energy and speed to the productive gentle side of Taurus. Imagine the sex life they could have, different from each other, two outcasts, if they only shared enough respect and emotion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey will rarely get this far, for they seem to be looking for different things in a relationship to begin with. Taurus would like to have a secure, unbreakable partnership and Aquarius wants to be free of any attachment to this world, let alone emotional relationships. It is not easy for them to mend these differences or keep them out of their sex life, because they wouldn’t feel like themselves in a relationship with disregard of their primal needs."},"Trust":{"Value":20,"Description":"If Taurus wasn’t so stressed out by their Aquarius partner, they might decide to be true and honest. Aquarius doesn’t really understand the attitude Taurus has and least of all their fear of not being good enough. Guilt and self-criticism is the most difficult trait of Taurus, and one Aquarius is free from, finding it obsolete. This strict Aquarius opinion will scare Taurus to the point where they feel it is impossible to tell how they feel. This will end in a circle of lies and mistrust that cannot be repaired.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere seems to be no flexibility in an Aquarius partner, although they tend to show a nature that is so open for people’s differences. In order to build the subtle trust, Taurus needs to be brave and stop thinking about the consequences of everything they say, while Aquarius needs to let go of their righteous attitude and be careful about the way their Taurus partner feels in their presence."},"Intellect":{"Value":10,"Description":"As a contact of Earth and Air elements, they can be so far apart that they can’t find anything to talk about. The sign of Taurus brings Uranus to its fall and all of those bright ideas Aquarius has, seem to go through the sieve of reality given by Taurus. This wouldn’t be a problem per se, but sometimes the narrow-minded Taurus doesn’t exactly see the true possibilities of the material world and can bring down their Aquarius partner to the point where they don’t see how any of their dreams is possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Taurus shows understanding for their partner’s need to fly, they could actually help them materialize what they have dreamed about. This doesn’t happen often, for Aquarius rarely finds Taurus as a person to talk to, slow and boring with a “small town” attitude that inhibits the progress of our civilization.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir differences are hard to reconcile and when they fall in love, every little thing could become a huge problem and a reason for both of them to think about ending the relationship. If Taurus wants a white picket fence, Aquarius wants a condo on 67th floor. If Taurus yearns for compassion, Aquarius doesn’t care about opinions of others. If Taurus wants to go by foot, Aquarius wants to buy a plane ticket. In general, they can find that they aren’t exactly made for each other, unless they both have enough flexibility to understand the ultimate difference in others, and enough openness to do things they don’t care about just to see if they like them in the end."},"Emotions":{"Value":15,"Description":"They are lucky that the sign of Aquarius lifts up spirits of Venus, or they wouldn’t really stand a chance. Taurus will rarely fall in love with an Aquarius due to the fact that they don’t recognize their ruler in a good context. Aquarius is distant enough as it is, and without excitement some other signs might offer, they will not exactly feel the electricity of being in love with an unmovable Taurus. However, they both might get tricked by the middle ground between them. If Taurus sees the stable, Saturn side of Aquarius, and Aquarius recognizes the inner child in their Taurus partner, they could discover that they do belong together, even though this goes against the odds."},"Values":{"Value":1,"Description":"While Taurus values material things and grounded behavior, Aquarius values freedom in any shape and form. One of them wants to be tied down, and the other wants to fly.

They can find certain things to value together, if they put their minds into creating them through Aquarius field of ideas and Taurus’ practical realizations."},"Activities":{"Value":5,"Description":"For a short time there could be a number of beautiful things they could do together. After the recourses of Taurus have been spent, there is not much else they will want to do together. By “recourses” we don’t necessarily speak of money, but the overall energy for action. Taurus will gladly visit a strange place they have never been to, but after this, they will want to come home and have a nice dinner. Aquarius doesn’t have this need and wants to always be on the move. They could be taken care of through the efforts of their Taurus partner, if they had enough patience to keep them well fed, dressed in clean clothes and took care of household activities. Still, this compromise is rare to find, because the emotional satisfaction Taurus partner will get in return is not enough."},"Summary":{"Value":11,"Description":"Taurus and Aquarius are people from two different worlds. Still, there is a strange similarity and connection between their rulers and although very challenging, this is a relationship where both partners could fall in love with each other, over and over again, every single day.

They are two outcasts, different and standing out together, they understand that East can be where West is, and vice versa. They understand diversity, change of direction and the excitement of love. However, they will rarely get to the point to understand each other because of their excessive need for peace (Taurus) and excitement (Aquarius). What a strange pair these signs are. With such an obvious opportunity for electric love, they go around it and search for something else."}},"Pisces":{"Love":{"Value":99,"Description":"Taurus and Pisces are both all about pleasure. Taurus represents the art of love making, tenderness and sensuality. The sign of Pisces is a culmination of a sexual encounter – orgasm. This is a place where Venus is exalted, magical, mysterious and unbelievably satisfying for Taurus’ ruler. They have the ability to get lost in each other, make their dreams come true and satisfy each other by pure existence.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it comes to sex, Taurus can easily end up in a rut if their partner isn’t inspiring or creative enough. They don’t even care, for as long as their emotional needs are met and their physical body respected. Pisces on the other hand, get lost in sexual experiences, and can even find them toxic if their impressions on other people are unrealistic. When they meet the right Taurus partner, they can be intrigued and relieved by their nature, for what they see is actually what they get.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of the emotional nature of the sign of Pisces and their deep sense of purpose, Taurus will feel loved to the point of getting lost in the sexuality of their partner. They will both pay very little attention to their own pleasure because of all those feelings guiding them. This is almost always a giving relationship where both partners are equally satisfied when it comes to sex."},"Trust":{"Value":80,"Description":"Because of the Pisces’ tendency to enter each relationship with an idealistic approach, there is a great chance they will open up to their Taurus partner as soon as they realize how stable and secure they seem. The beauty of their contact is in the fact that when together, they both lose their need to hide and let their emotions grow with ease.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sign of Pisces is a sign of mutable quality, and they can unexpectedly change, without a clear reason. If this happens, Taurus will know that the trust is lost, however their relationship seemed just a couple of minutes ago. It is a deep sense of broken intimacy, lost in the Pisces’ need for emotional exhilaration. Basically, when Pisces partner gets bored, they start to think of excuses and lies, before they even realize that their relationship is over.

Subtlety of Pisces is something truly inspiring for Taurus and they will feel the need to get to know every detail in their partner’s behavior. Both of these signs are not very talkative and Pisces even lead Mercury to its fall. This is why they really need to form a strong emotional bond and listen to each other through very little words.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat field of talent and creative energy that Pisces carries along goes well with Taurus’ need for beauty. Unfortunately, they can get lost in the world of Pisces and really lose that grip they have on reality. At first, this will be like a drug, an addiction, something they have been waiting for their entire life. As time goes by, the feeling will not be this good, for they will lose touch with themselves and have a feeling they don’t know who they are anymore. The most important thing for Taurus in a relationship with Pisces is to stand their ground and hold on to their common sense, practicality and their usual need to live in reality."},"Emotions":{"Value":99,"Description":"Taurus and Pisces have a magical emotional connection. For as long as Pisces don’t change their mind and swim off, their relationship should be filled with love and wonder. With Pisces exalting Venus, the ruler of Taurus, this is not only love but adoration. Taurus will feel, for however long, like the center of someone’s world, loved and cherished to the point of unbearable beauty. If this feeling goes on, they could stay in a beautiful relationship for a very long time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as Pisces partner feels this beautiful emotion dying down, they will make a spontaneous maneuver to distance themselves from their Taurus partner. The funny thing is that in most cases Taurus won’t be hurt at all. That simple feel of inadequacy will be enough for both of them to let distance take its course.

In its healthy image, this is mostly a combination of passion, energy and curiosity. In a not so healthy one, their sexual relationship can be full of nasty words and verbal aggression. The good thing is that neither is too sensitive and easily hurt, so this can be exciting and unique for both of their experiences.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince Aries is a warrior by nature, Gemini’s approach to sex might be too playful for their taste, but this is usually only until they open up to the everlasting game provided by Gemini partner.

Aries is passionate, ruled by Mars and possibly very jealous. Gemini is ruled by Mercury, the zodiac’s trickster, always changing the face they wear for the world. Most Gemini representatives aren’t even aware of their basic individuality, convinced that they change personality overnight. Although this is not exactly true, the sense that Aries can get from them is not exactly a recipe for trust. Because of this, Aries might get angry, Gemini distracted and distant, to the point where Aries starts looking for another partner even if the relationship has not ended and Gemini doesn’t even care anymore"},"Intellect":{"Value":85,"Description":"Aries is simply not the master of the art of conversation. Gemini is a sign ruled by Mercury and conversation is their main life theme. Even if they talk less than a typical Gemini usually does, their inner dialogue must be rich. Both partners should approach the relationship as if Gemini person was there to teach Aries how to have a good conversation. Since Gemini loves to be in a role of a teacher and loves to be in a relationship in which their partner learns something from them, this should be a good approach for both of them. That is if Aries’ ego allows this “submissive” role.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, we are all aware that there are some Gemini representatives that simply talk too much about nothing significant at all. This would be a reason for Aries to lose their temper and think of their partner as superficial and even stupid. This loss of respect is truly bad for their own ego, since the decision to be with this partner was theirs in the first place. They should remember that there is always somebody in the world who wouldn’t think of this specific Gemini as stupid and that everyone deserves to be with someone who doesn’t see them in this light. When this disrespect happens in their relationship, Aries should consider letting their Gemini go and look for someone who suits them better."},"Emotions":{"Value":60,"Description":"Emotional realm is a tricky territory for this couple. Aries partner has warm, passionate emotions and a problem to express them. Gemini often doesn’t go very deep beneath the surface to look for someone’s hidden qualities and isn’t really that emotional by nature. So this is a mix of an emotional partner who can’t communicate how they feel, and a rational one who talks about everything else. The good thing is that Aries does not lack the fierceness to turn Gemini’s attention to them and make them listen. When they manage to connect in a constructive dialogue, it is possible for them to explain to each other where they stand and how they feel, and this way set a good foundation for future emotional exchange."},"Values":{"Value":75,"Description":"When you calculate the fact that Aries values a person’s ability to be clear and concise, and Gemini’s need to talk around everything, it seems pretty obvious that this is not a perfect match.

Well this is not exactly true. Gemini partners value knowledge and someone’s literal abilities, as well as a fine rational mind. This is something Aries can fulfill to a certain point, in case they don’t react on impulse to everything Gemini says.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not that difficult for these partners to respond to each other’s needs, but if they don’t share similar education, interests and strength of character, they might see each other unworthy of their affection."},"Activities":{"Value":50,"Description":"Gemini is all for activity however insane certain activities might be, and Aries will feel liberated in this relationship.

They motivate and challenge each other all the time and they both never say “no”. Choices of activities Aries come up with must be truly aggressive and ridiculous for Gemini not to engage. If Gemini thinks of something that Aries would maybe like to refuse, their ego wouldn’t let them and they would jump in anyway, just to prove that they can. This much excitement should be followed by enough rest and time spent at home."},"Summary":{"Value":74,"Description":"The overall impression of this couple would be good, exciting and challenging, a relationship where both partners can learn a lot and be active in a healthy way. The main problem with their romantic involvement is the lack of trust, especially if Aries partner gets too attached to Gemini, always fighting for their freedom. The need for conversation with a lot of essence is bigger than any positive or any negative aspects of their relationship and both of them should always have this in mind.

After all, they are one of the Air signs and in their world thoughts have to be preoccupied, while strong communication is something that gives the possibility of a good sexual life.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Taurus could stay at home, in bed, all they long, cuddling with their sweetheart and ordering food, Gemini would like to get out and be intimate at all not so intimate places. Their sex life could become the source of most of their problems, as soon as Gemini gets bored or Taurus annoyed by the lack of emotional essence."},"Trust":{"Value":10,"Description":"Trust can be a real issue with this couple. Gemini is not all that trustworthy when someone tries to tie them down. Taurus, in most cases, lives for the day when they will be tied down with someone simultaneously. If they don’t start their relationship on a clear and truthful foundation, where the first thing they learn about each other would be the level of commitment each of them wants, a true problem with trust will easily arise.\\r\\n\\r\\nGemini partner will start thinking of excuses to get out of any obligation imposed on them by Taurus, only to avoid hurting their feelings. In response, Taurus will sense something is wrong and start obsessing about their partner’s behavior and the things they say. This can come to the point of absolute distrust between them, especially if Taurus gets really angry and “vindictive” in their usual passive and stubborn manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nGemini’s intentions are often misinterpreted here and this can lead to a number of following situations that will hurt them both. It is very important for them to discuss into detail what they both wish for while their relationship grows. This way, they could prevent misunderstanding that could lead to an unrepairable lack of trust."},"Intellect":{"Value":60,"Description":"Taurus is a sign that precedes Gemini. In the astrological sense, this tells us that the sign of Gemini wouldn’t exist if Taurus wasn’t there. Basically, this means that Gemini partner wouldn’t do much if their physical needs weren’t taken care of. This is where their relationship has a strong connection, for Gemini partner might need someone like Taurus to take care of their body and its needs.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is very easy for an Air sign such as Gemini to forget to have lunch or sleep for a couple of hours per night. There are so many interesting things in the world that they just don’t want to miss. Taurus partner could cook a healthy meal, take care of their finances and insist on a daily schedule that would give their Gemini a good energetic base to invest in their ideas.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general, their interests are not that similar, but they can find a way to communicate, for none of them lacks gentleness and a way with words. If Gemini partner decides to slow down a little bit and Taurus opens up, they could even find out it is possible for them to have fun together. After all, they are ruled by Venus and Mercury, two inner planets that are, when combined, in charge of fun, sweet talk and the art of conversation."},"Emotions":{"Value":35,"Description":"It is not very likely they will share their emotions with ease and enjoy each other the way they might with some other zodiac representatives. Still, there is a gentle side to Taurus that can melt down even the coldest of hearts. In most cases, their best chance of a loving relationship is in the love Taurus feels. We wouldn’t say that Gemini is insensitive or unemotional, but they certainly have different approach to their emotional nature than the Earth sign of Taurus, that exalts the Moon.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Taurus falls in love with a Gemini, they will do anything to understand their nature. There is nothing that a gentle nature of Taurus can’t understand, however different from their personal primal character it might be. When their Gemini feels this deep and stable understanding, they could respond in a warm and childish way, learning that they can be free even when in love with someone like Taurus.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Values":{"Value":1,"Description":"While Taurus values the Earth, the material world, their emotions and what is stable in their life, Gemini values the Universe, the world of ideas, their rational mind and change. This is where their differences and element natures strongly diverge. They should really try hard to accept the true value of both their worlds in order to work out their differences.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Activities":{"Value":25,"Description":"They could find activities to enjoy together, but not at the same pace. Gemini likes things fast, while exciting, and Taurus would like to examine everything from the beginning to the end, set the value on each activity and thoroughly decide if they would want to repeat it or not. This will drive their Gemini crazy. It is best for both of them to walk, a lot, for this can keep Gemini grounded, while Taurus always needs movement not to end up in a static, inert, horizontal state. They could connect their passionate natures through some kind of art, especially if they managed to find a way to create something together. With Gemini’s ideas and Taurus’ practical sense, combined with the need for beauty, this should be a true work of art."},"Summary":{"Value":23,"Description":"The relationship between Taurus and Gemini doesn’t give much promise to begin with. Still, the fixed quality of the sign of Taurus can give them enough endurance and persistence to last in their intent to be with a Gemini, long enough for them to really get to know each other well. Although their chances to reconcile their differences are slim, if Taurus partner puts their whole heart into it, they might manage to become the most relevant part of their Gemini’s life as their base and their reliability in everything they do. In case they accept each other completely, Taurus will give Gemini their connection to planet Earth, to their body and their daily routine, giving them the base for health and normal functioning. In return, Gemini will give their Taurus wings and, better yet, teach them how to fly."}},"Gemini":{"Love":{"Value":80,"Description":"When we think of two Gemini in a sexual relationship, it is okay if we laugh a little. The image that comes to mind could easily be the image of two people with split personalities, trying to have sex by banging their heads together and talking at the same time. Although they will most certainly have an abundance of information on sexual activity, only after they have had some experience can they become great lovers. It is very rare for a Gemini as an Air sign, to be practical and find the way to manifest what they’ve read or heard about in the realm of reality and physical body. Their biggest quality is the ability to learn. With their desire to become great lovers, they will absorb knowledge through each of their relationship like a sponge.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo Gemini together will share information and coordinate their previous experiences with one another. They will be more satisfied when they teach their partner something, than they will be by sex itself. With their open minds and creative wit, there is probably not a single place they wouldn’t want to have sex with, nor a position they wouldn’t want to try out. It is not like they are promiscuous, but find joy and excitement in the change of scenery, especially if there is relative movement involved, too. So imagine a train, an airplane restroom or any means of transportation in which it is possible to hide.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, their sexual life can become empty when the excitement has passed if none of them has enough depth to bring into the act of sex. They are not even aware of the focus and emotional connection they need, until they find the right partner. Usually this is not another Gemini. Their hearts should be dug up and their relation to sexuality changed, before they get together with one of their kind. Any other scenario probably won’t keep them satisfied for very long.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Trust":{"Value":50,"Description":"They might not trust each other, but they don’t really care. They both know themselves, so it is easy to understand each other in all those flaky, superficial and changeable moods. Basically one of them is going to move in two minutes and the other one in three, so how can they trust each other to stay? If they knew their own next move, they might be able to build the trust with someone so similar to them. This is not something that will bother them. On the contrary, it will give them the freedom to be themselves, but rarely keep them in a relationship for too long."},"Intellect":{"Value":99,"Description":"Communication between a Gemini and another Gemini never ends. They will jump in each other’s sentences and use all possible communication tools, starting with the usual phone conversations and chat that will grow into dozens of chat variations, depending on the emoticon that they want to use. When they get together, there is always something to share, an idea to be up for discussion and a distance to be crossed on foot. It is wonderful to watch them together as they find someone who understands and speaks in the same language. For as long as there is enough respect and listening between them, the intellectual side of their relationship will be intact.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Emotions":{"Value":70,"Description":"The sign of Gemini is not that emotional to begin with. The good thing is that they both know this and find a rational explanation of the benefit of their mutual lack of emotion. Still, there is a need in each one of them to reach for something they can’t have. It is to be expected that the more open Gemini will build a deep emotional bond with their partner, although their feelings might not be returned.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince they rely on an intellectual connection with someone, they could find true emotional satisfaction in their communication, but this is easily shattered due to the fact that mental compatibility is not the same as emotional, let alone sexual. Often, they will deny this and hold on to what they have, until one of them gets swept of their feet by someone who wakes their emotions with silence."},"Values":{"Value":99,"Description":"When we say “freedom” we think of Aquarius, but in fact Gemini values freedom as much, if not even more than their Aquarius friend. This is a value that two Gemini will passionately share. They don’t like to be bored with tiresome details, obligations of a meaningful relationship, or their partner’s need for compassion that is not to be asked for. The problem is in the fact that they think too much, and feel much less. If they could get out of their head for a couple of seconds, they might realize that their chest is crying out for intimacy, closeness and compassion"},"Activities":{"Value":99,"Description":"This title says it all. They share activities. All of them. If one of them wants to do… well basically anything, the other one will follow out of pure curiosity, and vice versa. Even if both of them didn’t really want to do something, they will both do it together out of curiosity. After they share an experience, they will put it through a mind filter, talk it out, and move on to the next one. There is really no stopping for these two and no one can follow them like they can follow each other."},"Summary":{"Value":83,"Description":"The relationship between two Gemini will give other signs of the zodiac an almost certain headache. They will go everywhere together, do everything together and talk about everything with one another, again and again, until one of them loses interest in the other. Because of their possibly superficial approach, it is best if they have already had some relationships with depth before they met each other. This could give them the quality to last together for longer than a week or two.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn most cases, this is not a relationship they will want to stay in, although their mutual understanding is perfect. It is like they are too similar, and at the same time a relationship of too many personalities. If each of them isn’t gathered into one person, they will need someone who is, to hold their balance and not let them dissipate. In case they have built up personalities and each of them understands their own inner core, they can probably live forever and never consume the energy their connection brings.\\r\\n\\r\\n"}},"Cancer":{"Love":{"Value":5,"Description":"Gemini would go outside and have the weirdest sexual experiences, and Cancer would stay at home and wait for the night to be loved by their tender partner. This is not always the case, of course, but it is very rare for a Gemini partner to manage to relax their Cancer and make them join their sexual adventure. Still, there is a link between them, pretty strong for that matter. Cancer continues the sign of Gemini, and in a way their nature is a consequence of endless conversations and rational explanations.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Gemini partner has enough patience to talk to their partner about same things over and over, in time they could build enough intimacy to have a good sex life. In order for this scenario to develop, Cancer needs to talk, too. It will not be enough to say a sentence or two and expect that their Gemini will understand how they feel. If they manage to communicate, Cancer could actually wake the depth of their Gemini, giving them enough support to express their more emotional sexual personality.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they want their relationship to work, their sex life needs to be somewhere in the middle – intimate enough and exciting enough – for both partners to be satisfied."},"Trust":{"Value":25,"Description":"Gemini is a sign ruled by Mercury, our little trickster. It is not easy to trust a Gemini partner, especially if one is trying to take away their freedom. As a rational sign, they usually find no reason to lie or cheat on their partner, for as long as they don’t feel threatened by intimacy they are not ready for, or tied down.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe major task of Cancer in a relationship with Gemini is to let them be free. If they start living together, Gemini will have to stay out of their love nest and Cancer will spend a lot of time alone. This is a challenge, but both signs can have enough dedication to their personal values, and these partners should know better than to ruin their relationship with trivial lies."},"Intellect":{"Value":70,"Description":"\\"There is probably not a single sign in the zodiac that Gemini couldn’t talk to, so their communication skills mark this category a bit higher in every case. In their relation to a Cancer partner, they usually feel the need to open up a bit more and share things that they wouldn’t with other people. There is a certain “motherly” glow around Cancer, male or female, that gives Gemini enough room to set their inner child free.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis can actually be a wonderful relationship that lasts much longer than other Gemini relationships, because there is usually enough understanding in Cancer for their childlike partner. That is, if other aspects of the relationship are satisfying enough. It is safe to say that Cancer and Gemini make good friends and this could give a push in the right direction toward their emotional and sexual understanding as well.\\""},"Emotions":{"Value":10,"Description":"The main negative possibility here would be in the fact that Gemini doesn’t always listen. It is often said that Gemini is a superficial sign, but in fact, they like to stay afloat and keep away from difficult conversations because of their need to move forward. Cancer can try to share their emotions too often for Gemini to have enough patience to understand them, and this can be devastating for their emotional relationship.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, Gemini doesn’t really show emotions in a way that Cancer will easily recognize. It is a good thing they are capable of finding emotion in anything and anyone, so they might have a chance to understand the emotional nature of their childish Gemini."},"Values":{"Value":1,"Description":"They have completely different systems in which they value things in life. While Gemini is a rational sign, giving value to all that comes out of their mind, Cancer is an emotional guru, giving value to things their heart beats for. When it comes to relationships, they are probably the most vulnerable to differences in this category, for differences here make their primary goals different. Although they will both be motivated to find love, the way their partner acts in a relationship could be considered “wrong” due to its opposite nature from what each of them values."},"Activities":{"Value":15,"Description":"Activities Gemini and Cancer could share mainly depend on the energy level of Cancer partner. If they have enough of it to follow Gemini’s chaotic schedule, they could find a lot of enjoyable things to do together. Cancer is a sign that exalts Jupiter, and its representatives like to travel, as much as they like to feel at home due to the sign itself. Although Gemini partner doesn’t really have to go that far, they could find middle ground in travelling to places they both want to visit.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the main characteristic of Gemini is their curiosity. It will lead them in all directions, they will feel the need to try everything and find more new, exciting experiences to share with someone. Unfortunately Cancer doesn’t really enjoy this that much. While the relationship is new, it will all seem exciting and breathtaking. As time passes, Cancer will want to settle down, imagining them buying furniture together and raising children. It is not easy for them to accept that this nature Gemini has isn’t something that will be different tomorrow. There is no settling down with a Gemini partner. This is just not their mission in life."},"Summary":{"Value":21,"Description":"Gemini and Cancer are next to each other in the zodiac, and they are likely to be next to each other in friendship. When it comes to emotional or sexual relationships, there seems to be too many things that set them apart. In order for their relationship to last, they both need to make some adjustments. Gemini will hardly ever change their routine for someone, especially when they find someone’s way of life boring, so the best thing to do here is to give them their freedom. If Cancer falls in love deeply enough, they will understand what their Gemini partner needs, and won’t hold them back even if they wished for them to be different.\\r\\n\\r\\nGemini partner has to open their heart and listen to those few words that Cancer wants to share. Even though they can speak about many things, when it comes to discussions of their relationship, their views on it are different. Gemini needs to keep it interesting and Cancer needs to be heard, as much as felt. If they give each other enough freedom and understanding, they could be like children in love for the first time."}},"Leo":{"Love":{"Value":90,"Description":"Everything that Leo would like to show, Gemini would gladly examine. They are a very good fit when it comes to sex, for Gemini gives their relationship ideas and excitement, while Leo brings in energy, creativity and love. Their sex life can be stimulated by their intellect and communication, for they both rely on their conscious Self and their mind. If Leo feels right in intimate relations with their Gemini, as a fixed sign they will give them stability and a chance to last together for a very long time.\\r\\n\\r\\nGemini is childish when it comes to sex, and rarely connects deep emotion with sexuality. Leo could be the right partner to teach them how to make a real intimate connection if they are not preoccupied with themselves. They will both want to experiment, have sexual encounters outdoors and will enjoy being naked. This is a perfect relationship for both partners to overcome shame and any sort of fear regarding intimacy and sexuality."},"Trust":{"Value":45,"Description":"Both Gemini and Leo can be bad listeners when it comes to other people’s needs. One of them is distracted by everything and the other focused only on their own needs. Because of this they could end up in a situation in which their relationship lacks trust and it might take some time for them to notice, because they will not question one another at the beginning. Because of their natures, they could get lost, each of them satisfying their own needs. This will lead to all sorts of situations they don’t want to share with each other, even adultery. It is of outmost importance for them to share and listen to one another from the beginning, in order for both of them to be able to satisfy their partner’s needs instead of letting them slip away."},"Intellect":{"Value":95,"Description":"Gemini and Leo are both rational and focused on their mental activity. Leo does have a deep emotional background, but pays a lot of attention to words and intellectual strength of their partner. This is where Gemini jumps in as a faithful follower, to admire their Leo partner and teach them a thing or two.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they find themselves in an emotional relationship with each other, they will probably talk about everything else but their feelings. Leo might have the need to, in general, but Gemini partner will easily seduce them to go in another direction. They both don’t have much use for sweet talk and if Gemini tries to use the way they have with words, it could work only up to a point where they start sounding fake. There is not much room for overthinking, and they will both probably say the first thing that comes to their mind. This is a great way to build trust between them, if they don’t judge each other in the process and share some emotions along the way.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, there is an issue of Leo’s “perfect” Sun. This position gives so much energy to Leo that they sometimes feel obligated to burn everyone around them by imposing their will. This is a strange need of Leo, since the sign supports Sun greatly, but it is there. They usually have this idea to change the world and make it a better place, and this can drive their Gemini partner crazy in case they don’t have enough room for their own opinions."},"Emotions":{"Value":85,"Description":"The warmth that Leo is prepared to give to their Gemini partner will hardly leave them indifferent, while the charm and childish nature of Gemini is going to spark wonderful emotions in Leo, day after day. Although the mutable quality of Gemini partner doesn’t really go well with the fixed quality of any sign, with Leo it could be a perfect match because of their warm, supporting and respectful nature.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Leo has enough patience to wait for Gemini’s emotions to surface, they could get more than they’ve bargained for. The beauty of their relationship is the consciousness of both of them, leading to verbal display of emotions, once they feel safe with one another. If they both recognize love, this is a wonderful love story full of support, respect and always something new to discuss."},"Values":{"Value":99,"Description":"Most of all they both value intelligence and clarity. As two signs ruled by planets in charge for our mental, rational behavior, they will meet each other’s needs perfectly. Gemini values the independence of their partner and their own freedom, and this is exactly what Leo can give them. On the other hand, Leo always values their partner’s inner child and this is exactly what they will get in their Gemini.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Activities":{"Value":80,"Description":"It is a good thing Gemini wants to go everywhere and do everything, or these two might have a big problem finding activities they want to share. This way, Leo can lift their activities to a “higher level” going to all places that Gemini would suggest, but in a fancy, expensive version. Although Gemini wouldn’t really want to spend that much money, Leo doesn’t mind paying for everything, for as long as they are not feeling used.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, Leo can be very lazy. Gemini is always on the move, and has the need to do at least three different activities every day. When Leo has time to rest, they will probably want to watch TV and move from the left to the right side of the couch all day long. This is something that could build a gap between their worlds, but usually they have enough respect for each other’s needs that they can separate activities and be very happy together. None of them is needy and they don’t want to spend each moment of their lives with their partner, so it will give them both enough freedom – for Gemini to move and for Leo to rest."},"Summary":{"Value":82,"Description":"Gemini and Leo can have so much fun that it could make the rest of the zodiac envious. They both consider their day best spent in laughter, and if they share friends, they could seem like a perfect couple. Their main challenge is the difference in their approach to change and they both need to make room for small adjustments in their behavior if they want their relationship to last. Leo will need to make room for more movement and understand what seems to be “flakiness” of their changeable Gemini partner, while Gemini will have to understand that Leo is in fact keeping them together for however long they are meant to last. Their mutual respect can usually overcome any boundaries, and they should keep having fun and building their relationship on a solid foundation of childish joy."}},"Virgo":{"Love":{"Value":5,"Description":"Gemini and Virgo are both ruled by Mercury, not a very sexual planet at first glance. However, this affects them in different ways, for Gemini is a masculine sign, always ready to explore, while Virgo is a feminine sign, shy and sensitive. Their sexual relationship is hardly promising, but they both have the need to communicate. If they find a language they both understand, they might agree on the way their sexual life is to progress. However, there is a big chance that endless discussions will not lead to their mutual understanding, leaving them distant and not interested to share any sexual experiences.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they fall in love, they will use enough tenderness and respect to make their sex life work, but it will still rarely be satisfying for both partners. They are both curious, but not in the same way, and have an extrovert vs. introvert conflict. While Gemini would often like to be free to get naked and run around the streets, Virgo would prefer if everyone kept their bodily fluids to themselves. To top it all, they both need verbal stimulation, but the words each of them would like to hear often aren’t what the other person knows how to say."},"Trust":{"Value":1,"Description":"What a combination! With Virgo’s trust issues and Gemini’s trickster nature, both of them are about to go crazy. The good thing is that they are not prone to jealousy, or they would probably kill each other after a couple of weeks. Gemini is not someone Virgo can trust. When Virgo starts doubting and analyzing everything, Gemini will simply fly away, in the best case scenario. If they have a touch through maleficent planets, such as Mars, this will not end there, but in endless fights and conflicts on trust and fidelity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe key here is for Gemini to get back to planet Earth and respect the sensitive nature of their partner. They can build their security and be free to be who they are at the same time. Also, Virgo will have to open up, or they will never find a way to stay together."},"Intellect":{"Value":80,"Description":"They are ruled by the same planet, master of communication, Mercury. They may have their differences, but we wouldn’t say their communication is bad. Even if they have a fight, they will still be good at talking. Their view on intellect could be a bit different though. Gemini’s superficial nature could seem extremely stupid to their Virgo partner. This will set Gemini off to be even more irritating on purpose, because they are everything but stupid. In return, Gemini will see Virgo’s obsession with details and think of them as crazy. Virgo will probably not fight this, but sit in their room and cry, alone, in the dark.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey need to find a way to recognize each other’s “flaws” as good qualities and they will get there if each of them lets their partner help. When these minds come together, there is no problem to stay unsolved, for together, they are Mercury in all its glory. These signs have a mission to unite and transform heavenly ideas into real life, and lift human knowledge step by step, towards divinity. This is a relationship of the Air side of Mercury and its Earth side, grounded and well thought of. It shouldn’t be forgotten that the sign of Virgo exalts Mercury so Virgo can exalt their Gemini partner, if only they wanted to land."},"Emotions":{"Value":55,"Description":"Gemini is considered not that emotional. Virgo brings Venus to its fall and rationalizes everything. Still, there is an interesting emotional side to both of them. Gemini is located between Taurus and Cancer, two strong, feminine, motherly signs. This means that the sign of Gemini is formed out of Taurus and is a base for Cancer. How can it lack emotion than? Virgo has a problem with Venus, that is true, but does this make Virgo unemotional?\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir biggest problems are speed and fear. Gemini simply doesn’t stay in one place for long enough to build an emotional bond or recognize how they feel, while Virgo tries hard to dismiss Venus and with it love and all earthly pleasures because they don’t think they deserve any of it. Both signs have a small, fast planet in common, and if they touch each other’s hearts, they will understand their partner’s occasional need to run off, or run away."},"Values":{"Value":70,"Description":"They are both fans of intelligence, resourcefulness and practicality. However, their approach to basic intelligence is different and they won’t always recognize it in the same way. In fact their relationship can show us exactly how relative intelligence is. Their meeting point is actually in their emotional intelligence, not our typical one. However, they do value rationality, someone’s ability to reason and one’s practical use of their hands and their brain."},"Activities":{"Value":30,"Description":"It is a good thing they both like to read, so they can visit a library every once in a while. Virgo will probably stay there for a bit longer, not even noticing their Gemini partner got lost and accidentally found an emergency exit that they had to use to see how the big handle on huge red door works. The lack of self-value Virgo suffers from constantly will make them question every location and activity their Gemini partner would want to take them to. Even if they try to hide it, their hesitation will be felt and Gemini will rather go alone than push someone to come along.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth of these signs are mutable and as such have a tendency to change locations, interests, relationships. This can allow them to stay on the move together, if only Virgo was open enough for exciting new experiences and Gemini finds a way to not get lost."},"Summary":{"Value":40,"Description":"The relationship of Gemini and Virgo can change as the wind, while both partners get lost and found on a daily basis. Their mutual love for Mercury is what binds them and what tears them apart, because they both tend to overthink things instead of following their hearts. Both of them are mostly in their minds, each one in their own way, and need to respect each other to the point where no one’s intelligence is judged on a superficial level. If they do fall in love, they will become a unification of Air and Earth Mercury – heaven on Earth."}},"Libra":{"Love":{"Value":80,"Description":"Gemini and Libra are both guided by the element of Air and this should give them a good start for their mental connection and verbal understanding. When it comes to sex, this is a plus, for they will both be free to communicate anything that bothers or satisfies them. Fragile ego of Libra can be lifted by Gemini’s charm and approach to sex. They seem to know how to make everything a little less serious and this will help their Libra partner open up and share their emotions through sex, too. When Gemini partner sees how mellow Libra can be, although they seem so tactful and cold, they won’t have much choice but to share emotions as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main goal in their sexual life is, in fact, to balance these emotions. Libra is a sign ruled by Venus, sexual, sensual and seductive, while Gemini is ruled by Mercury, having no sexual or emotional wisdom. The basis of a good sex life between them is their curiosity, for Libra is always curious about their partner, as much as Gemini is curious about everything else. Although Libra might be indecisive, Gemini won’t have a problem thinking of a different approach and finding new techniques, words and adventures to spice up their sexual encounters.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Trust":{"Value":95,"Description":"When Libra decides to be with someone, even if it is after a long, hard inner battle, they will probably believe in their words and their actions. When they choose a partner, they choose them for their character and their straightforward nature. Libra has no reason to doubt their own judgment and will probably believe their Gemini in every case, except when their dishonesty is too obvious. In return, Gemini will respect Libra’s need to flirt in order to be accepted and loved by other people. Not only will they not find this threatening, but they will actually enjoy a consequence of this behavior – their own freedom."},"Intellect":{"Value":60,"Description":"Gemini partner is very opinionated and Libra has a tendency to take a lot of things their partner says as a personal insult. Although Gemini will, in most cases, just follow their rational nature and comment on things simply because they want to talk, it will be hard on Libra to overcome some of the things they might say. The sign of Libra is very sensitive to any sort of will imposing or criticism and will recognize it even when Gemini has no idea what their partner is imagining. Who’s to say which one of them is right?\\r\\n\\r\\nSince no two people can agree on everything every time each of them opens their mouth to speak, Gemini and Libra can have a very hurtful and tough communication due to the mutual lack of tolerance. Gemini partner would rather go blind than accept that they have a lack of tolerance, but the truth is they can be quite strict when it comes to someone’s mental activity and their opinions. Libra is in most cases hurt enough by the pressure on their personality produced in their primal family, so they will have a very bad response to this behavior even if Gemini meant nothing wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main issue here is in the fact that Gemini lives to learn and teach what they have learned. They often present themselves as someone who knows things, and Libra can see this as their need to prove their intellectual dominance. Even though this isn’t their intention in most cases, sometimes a single sentence Gemini said can be something Libra feels hurt by for years to come. Libra can learn from a teacher, from someone who has proven their worth, but hardly from their know-it-all partner."},"Emotions":{"Value":90,"Description":"The way Libra’s emotions develop is something really suitable for Gemini. They seem to be in sync while Libra partner searches for depth, and Gemini flies around looking for a new discovery. They won’t even notice as love between them starts to show, one of them running around and the other thinking about reasons why they wouldn’t be perfect together.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe could say that neither of them is very emotional, but Libra is ruled by Venus, so there is a strong link to an emotional plain here. The problem develops when they both talk too much about their emotions, while none of them stops to actually feel. They can remain detached and distant, unless Libra falls in love deeply enough to follow their Gemini partner wherever they go, and Gemini falls in love deeply enough for all words to lose meaning."},"Values":{"Value":55,"Description":"While Libra will value consistency and someone being responsible and reliable, Gemini will be very different from this, with opposing values as well. Gemini will value someone’s creativity and intellectual strength and this is something Libra can’t respond to if their Sun is in its lowest state. Their meeting point is in their value of intellect, however strange it may seem. They are both Air signs and give a lot of attention to their partner’s mental personality and the way they think. They could find a way to tease each other with words, seduce each other with words, seduce each other and in the end find a way to communicate everything else – in case they both care enough."},"Activities":{"Value":85,"Description":"Libra is your typical activity chameleon when they fall in love. They want to examine the world of their partner, beginning to end, and will gladly follow them around in all their activities expecting the same in return. However, this can end in an unfortunate way, leaving Libra with their energy drained and wishes not granted. Gemini just doesn’t care about following their partner only because they want to be followed. Both of them need to keep their expectations low and let their partner surprise them by something new and exciting. They will enjoy various activities together, but in order to do so, they need to respect each other’s limits and desires to begin with.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Summary":{"Value":78,"Description":"Gemini and Libra partners are not exactly always a perfect couple, although their signs support each other. If Libra partner has trouble being alone and doing things by themselves, this isn’t something Gemini will easily understand. Due to their lack of personal boundaries, Libra representatives will often let their Gemini partners lead the way until all of their energy is gone, they feel like they should only lie down and turn their brain off. If they want to work on their relationship and be happy, Libra needs to respect their Gemini partner enough to let them be their teacher, lover and a friend. In return, Gemini will have to take care of their Libra partner, respecting their limits and their need for togetherness."}},"Scorpio":{"Love":{"Value":1,"Description":"A sexual relationship between a Gemini and a Scorpio is like a connection of the deepest and the highest point on planet Earth. Gemini is so far off from Scorpio’s emotional world that good sex between them seems like something almost impossible to happen. This couple needs to be supported by other positions in their natal charts if they are to stand any chance of lasting in a loving, sexual relationship.\\r\\n\\r\\nGemini can be superficial and there is no other sign who knows this better, than Scorpio. Their Air element combined with the rule of Mercury and its lack of emotion is close to Scorpio’s worst nightmare. Scorpio is a sign of our deepest emotions and as such, linked to the most intimate side of sexuality. When they begin a relationship with Gemini, it probably never crosses their mind that such an asexual person can exist in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they fall in love with each other, there is so much for both of them to learn. Scorpio gives a strong focus on their sex life and can be very creative when relaxed. Still, they have a tendency to make a dark, sadistic or masochistic atmosphere that Gemini can only laugh at. If their mutual respect is at a very high point, Gemini could teach Scorpio that not everything needs to be so fatalistic in their sex life. In return, Scorpio will give their Gemini partner depth and emotional vibe to sex that they have never encountered before."},"Trust":{"Value":5,"Description":"Scorpio trusts everyone until they don’t. They have this weird, possessive nature that can give ultimate trust to their partner until the first worm of suspicion is created, usually by flakiness and disrespect. They like things clean and without a doubt, and are prepared to give unconditional honesty, expecting the same in return. This is where Gemini comes and asks a simple question – how can I be honest when I don’t know what my truth is in the first place? It is ridiculous to expect such a definite honesty out of a Gemini partner when they are so prone to change and have no idea what they will feel or do tomorrow. Still, they have a knack for communication that can save the day, but it can only be used if Scorpio doesn’t feel threatened because of their previous heartbreak they’ve never healed from."},"Intellect":{"Value":20,"Description":"It is a good thing that Gemini can communicate with anyone. They will be moved and intrigued by Scorpio’s nature, and very curious as usual. This will be amplified by Scorpio’s depth and interesting topics, up to the point where they get too dark and depressive. This is something Gemini doesn’t want to deal with if they don’t have to. Unfortunately, there is not a lot that Scorpio thinks they can learn from Gemini. Although they might wish to be more superficial, when they get in contact with someone with less depth, their ego sparks and they feel dominant because they are just the way they are. They will hardly ever respect Gemini for this, and can try to feed on their personality in order to add quality to their own.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn case they share interests and have similar professional or educational directions, they could complement each other very well. Gemini would give ideas and discover new information, while Scorpio will dig in and give real essence to everything. Their communication can be inspirational if they get into this mode and start accepting each other’s qualities. They have so much to give to each other and it would be a shame if they held their relationship in an ego conflict for too long.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Emotions":{"Value":1,"Description":"Emotional lack of compatibility is what ruins their sex life and gives them both a headache. If one of them falls in love with the other, they will hardly have a good time if their feelings are not returned in the same proportion. We could say it’s hard for them to synchronize, because the emotions Scorpio would give away freely are something Gemini would have to be swept off their feet for. They don’t seem to have the same emotional scale and this can leave them both unsatisfied or pressured to a breaking point. The best option for their shared emotional world would be for both partners to give what they can and not expect anything in return."},"Values":{"Value":20,"Description":"The good thing in their relationship is that they both value strength of thought. Although Scorpio values many other things in someone’s personality, they will be impressed by someone’s intelligence and resourcefulness. Gemini will focus on the same thing, but have a slightly different assessment of someone’s intellect. However, they can agree to have a shared point of same value, although other things they strive for will differ greatly.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Activities":{"Value":40,"Description":"A great thing with these two is their openness for change. Gemini will want to change the scenery and Scorpio will want to change their life, gladly taking Gemini’s small steps toward this goal. Scorpio is a fixed sign, set in change of huge proportions, and Gemini’s mutable quality will annoy them in most cases. Still, they can relate to their need for different experiences in life and the excitement they always search for. Even though they might not be excited by the same things, there will be enough excitement for both partners to choose along the path they decide to cross together."},"Summary":{"Value":15,"Description":"Gemini and Scorpio will usually annoy each other senseless. None of them will lightly understand their partner’s personality. To Gemini, their partner will seem too depressed and dark for no apparent reason, and for Scorpio, this could be an experience with no purpose or depth. If they do fall crazy in love, they could connect through their mutual love of change and give each other the exact things they lack. Gemini would get deep, emotional satisfaction they have never felt before and Scorpio would finally get the chance to rest their troubled soul, and realize that not everything needs to be taken seriously. This is a relationship of great lessons and an enormous capacity for personal growth of both partners.\\r\\n\\r\\n"}},"Sagittarius":{"Love":{"Value":90,"Description":"Gemini and Sagittarius have this strange approach to sex, childish and light as if they don’t really care about it. When they get together, they usually get strangely involved in emotions none of them really understands. Their sex life is something to cherish, easy, open and with no pressure at any side. They will both enjoy their sexual relations, followed by laughter, creativity and joy. As two children in bodies of grown-ups, they could go through the feeling of shame together if they don\'t have much experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they meet a bit older, there is a slim chance that both of them didn’t have enough sexual experiences and partners to understand their personal needs and desires. This can make them both a bit selfish, but if their communication keeps going, there is no reason why this would be a turn off for anyone.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a strange thing, but sex is really not that important to these partners. They are looking for someone to complete their mental personalities, someone to talk to and give them a sense of purpose. This is why they could decide to stay friends after a breakup, for their starting premise was in building a strong relationship founded on their personalities, rather than their sexual or emotional natures.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Trust":{"Value":99,"Description":"If anyone can understand the need of their partner to not be faithful, it’s these two. Strangely enough, this can lead to ultimate faithfulness, for there will be no more excitement in the secrecy and mystery of parallel relationships. Sagittarius is not someone who can tell a lie and keep a straight face, and they are usually really disturbed by the lies of other people. Gemini can tell a lie with such ease that they sometimes don’t even know they’re lying. When they get together, this all becomes something to have fun with and they could play a game of trust until they build it on strong foundations of mutual respect."},"Intellect":{"Value":99,"Description":"Wow! This kind of understanding is truly something to cherish. A problem can surface when they are both preoccupied with chasing their personal values and don’t see what they have with each other. As opposing signs they complement each other in general, but this is strongly sensed in this segment of their relationship. With Gemini’s ideas and mind flow, there is nothing Sagittarius can’t learn or share, being a student and a teacher at the same time. The curiosity goes both ways and they will spend days just learning about each other and absorbing shared experiences.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only thing that can interfere with the quality of their mental connection is the possible fear of intimacy that builds in the meantime. That strength of personal exchange stops being mental and starts being emotional at some point, and as two signs that aren’t exactly emotional to begin with, they can be frightened by the intensity of emotions that are surfacing when they are together.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general, this is a couple you want to hang out with, every day. They will literally share happiness with one another and with those around them. They can inspire anyone to love and to smile, because when in love, they will laugh so sincerely and have so much fun together. The “here-and-there” nature of Gemini will get new meaning and purpose through the eyes of their Sagittarius, while the search for the ultimate truth can be so much easier for a Sagittarius with the mind of a Gemini. Their optimism and their eloquence will multiply, day after day, until one of them gets scared and decides to take off or death do them part."},"Emotions":{"Value":95,"Description":"It is kind of strange to think about the emotional side of the relationship between a Gemini and a Sagittarius. Both signs have a non-emotional feel to them, but their contact develops so much emotion that maybe neither one of them will be able to cope with it. They are not used to feeling that much, and when they “click”, Sagittarius could discover the new meaning of life and Gemini a synthesis that they’ve never had a chance to experience. This can truly be a fascinating love story, if only they don’t run away from all that emotion."},"Values":{"Value":70,"Description":"There is this important thing they both value – things that make sense. As opposing signs it might seem that Gemini is scattered and superficial, while Sagittarius is collected and deep, but in fact they have the same core in the fact that everything needs to make sense. Usually, we would connect this with the sign of Sagittarius, but Gemini has it in their approach to words and everyday actions. Their Mercury can’t deal with senseless words, stories without meaning and purpose, whatever that purpose may be."},"Activities":{"Value":99,"Description":"Not only will they share every activity that any of them thinks of, but they will also laugh all the way, whatever they decide to do together. This positive emotion and pure joy they can share, becomes something like a happy drug to both of them and they no longer want to be apart. As two mutable signs, they understand each other’s changeability and flexibility, perfectly capable to find all the right reasons why everything they do makes perfect sense. There is a point when they will get irritating to their surroundings, like two spoiled children without a care in the world, but while they are this happy – why would they care?"},"Summary":{"Value":92,"Description":"Gemini and Sagittarius make an incredible couple, probably being the most innocent one of all oppositions in the zodiac. They don’t often find each other right away, but at some point in life it is almost certain that a Gemini will find their Sagittarius and vice versa. Their relationship has a strong intellectual connection, in which they will gradually find deep emotions. There is no real prognosis how this will end though, because the emotions they feel could easily scare them away and their relationship could end only because of fear. If they decide to give in and find out what they could share, with Gemini’s ideas and Sagittarius’ beliefs, the sky is the limit. Or is it beyond?"}},"Capricorn":{"Love":{"Value":1,"Description":"There are certain activities that don’t require many words, and in Capricorn’s humble opinion sex is one of them. Then Gemini comes along and starts explaining each position, the interesting overview on Kama Sutra and the beauty of outdoor sex. It is almost unbearable to watch these partners with their completely different philosophies while they try to maneuver their sex life.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order for Capricorn to experiment in sex, their partner needs to manage to really relax them and open their mind. With Gemini, they feel like taking care of a child heading for trouble, getting naked wherever they feel like it. Although this is not actually the case, this is how it may seem to Capricorn, reliant on traditional values and always taking responsibility for their actions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn most cases, they will hardly even be attracted to one another. If they become sexual partners, there is a big chance that Gemini will find their Capricorn partner uncreative and stiff, while Capricorn would think of Gemini as too unconventional. The strangest thing in this combination of the signs is in the fact they will both probably consider each other boring. Yes, everyone would say Capricorn can be boring and Gemini is so interesting and fun, but actually, the lack of focus and deep feelings Gemini partner usually suffers from, is a huge turn off for Capricorn. All things considered, these two are not actually the best sexual partners among the zodiac signs, but could make a meeting point in a relationship with enough boundaries and enough creativity of both partners."},"Trust":{"Value":50,"Description":"A typical Capricorn representative will not be easily tricked. Gemini partner can have a tendency to flirt a lot and to consider “light adultery” normal. This is thinking of a crazy person in the opinion of a Capricorn, and there are no “levels” of adultery in their world. What’s clear is clear. Still, because of Capricorn’s trust equation that makes their life easy, they will tend to trust their Gemini. Actually, they will trust their own interpretation of what Gemini says.\\r\\n\\r\\nCapricorn always goes one step deeper than others, and Gemini rarely puts that much thought into their alibies. This is why Capricorn will read them with so much ease, probably knowing exactly where they’ve been and what they are dishonest about. Gemini, on the other hand, will find Capricorn so square and by the book, that they won’t even doubt their faithfulness and honesty, even if they have something to hide."},"Intellect":{"Value":25,"Description":"It is safe to say that Gemini can talk to anyone and settle any issue by communicating. Unfortunately, this doesn’t mean a lot to a Capricorn when they recognize the lack of essence in the things their partner says. However, they will still have a lot to talk about because there is always that serious side to Gemini in one of their personalities that will have a thing or two to share with a strict and sometimes difficult Capricorn.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a good thing that Gemini are interested in literally everything that exists in the world and outside of it. So if nothing else works, they can always talk about Space Stations, diamond stars and other galaxies. Capricorn is interested in things that have deep, hidden meaning, looking at them as equations that should be solved and admiring problem solvers. They could spend their life in this strange analysis that is not so much focused on details as maybe Virgo’s would be, but on the bridge between different worlds. Capricorn is fascinated by the before and after logic behind every little thing, and this is where Gemini can help them set a list to investigate.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they are at peace and don’t look at each other as stupid, distant or boring, they could help one another build a better understanding for the world. Capricorn’s steady, secure nature could teach Gemini how to make schedules and organize their thoughts and their actions, giving them a chance to move each thought a step further. In return, Gemini’s childish approach to life can be something wonderful for Capricorn to incorporate in their life in order to be happier."},"Emotions":{"Value":1,"Description":"Ruled by Mercury and Saturn, both signs are not that emotional, but the real problem is in the fact that they usually don’t even spark some emotions in one another. Although both of them can have relationships with other not-so-emotional signs in which they feel awakened with their partner, when they are with each other, they can be immune to each other’s charm. There is just not that much to connect them and mostly their emotional relationship comes down to Gemini’s dark thoughts and Capricorn’s emotional distance."},"Values":{"Value":5,"Description":"Gemini truly values information in any form and shape, someone’s ability to talk beautifully, to creatively use their hands and to implement ideas with a higher purpose. Capricorn values stability, punctuality and plain honesty. Although they will both be dazzled by the independence of their partner, the rest of their worlds rarely coincide that much."},"Activities":{"Value":10,"Description":"They would both walk a lot, that’s true, but the divergence of their motives is almost unbelievable. Capricorn is a sign of useful things, and they will want to have useful activity, whatever it may be. If they do go for a walk, they will want to do this in order to get from point A to point B, or to have a healthier lifestyle. When Gemini walks, they never know where they’ll end up. They might have started their route on the way to the supermarket, but one telephone call later, they are already in their car, heading to a different city. It is a good thing that Gemini always wants to learn new things and Capricorn likes routine and dedication, so they have a strong base for constructive studying and problem solving. However, in most cases, their roads go in different directions."},"Summary":{"Value":15,"Description":"Gemini and Capricorn partners are a very strange fit. Although they are both looking for things the other person has, they don’t seem to recognize them in each other. While Gemini needs someone to ground them and give them depth, when they look at Capricorn, they see someone old, unmovable and boring. Capricorn needs joy and relaxation in their life, but Gemini seems like a ball of uncontrollable, superficial opinions heading nowhere. In truth, they could have a valuable experience being together, sharing their different lives day after day. They might even find out that they actually work well together and have the ability to reach any goal that they think of."}},"Aquarius":{"Love":{"Value":85,"Description":"Gemini and Aquarius could probably have sex by simple verbal stimulation. They don’t need to get naked to have a sexual experience, although they will want to be naked all the time to set themselves free from all the human restrictions represented through clothes. They will get lost on their way to somewhere and have sex there. Or somewhere else. But who cares when they are in search for kindred spirits and want to have a good time while at it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey will both be aroused by the intellectual side of their relationship and if they are to be satisfied, they have to consider each other intelligent. Neither Gemini nor Aquarius will ever be in a serious relationship with someone who is, in their opinion, stupid. Even something that they would call an “insignificant sexual encounter” has to be with someone with enough wit and something to say.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey can have sex anywhere and none of them would care. Gemini is a bit childish and can be ashamed in certain situations, but when Aquarius takes over, Gemini will realize that there is no limit to their freedom of expression. These partners will try everything, communicate excessively and learn quickly about each other’s body and the way to satisfy one another. Still, their relationship could lack emotion and true physical intimacy. This could lead to them pulling apart, often not aware that they both need something else in their partner."},"Trust":{"Value":90,"Description":"Trust is a strange thing for this couple. We should emphasize that they will trust each other. Aquarius finds lying ridiculous and Gemini will usually feel free enough not to lie. On the other hand, Aquarius understands one’s need for privacy, for this is a sign where Neptune is exalted. They will both probably have this ultimate trust for their partner and are rarely deceived because of their premise to give and receive freedom as an absolute priority. None of them will have any satisfaction in storytelling or lying when there are so many interesting things to talk about with their weirdo partner, and so little to share that will be judged."},"Intellect":{"Value":99,"Description":"When Gemini and Aquarius engage in an intellectual debate, they are fun for everyone to watch. They stimulate each other’s mind to such a point that they fire arguments they weren’t aware existed in their thoughts. While Gemini will probably be fascinated by the belief system of Aquarius, always so rational and humane, Aquarius will have an opportunity to relieve some of their ego problem with their Gemini partner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mutable quality of Gemini will allow them to adapt to some of those rigid Aquarian attitudes and opinions, even if they disagree. Gemini does have this mellow nature that understands the flow of the social touch with other people, and will rarely fight for their beliefs with someone they feel really close to. This is a good thing for their everyday life, but in general, this can present a problem because the authentic personality of Gemini could be shushed until they are not sure who they are anymore, once again.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is important for them to have enough flexibility for one another, however different their premises might be. Still, it is best if they share the same basic life philosophy, which they usually do, or they could get distant and lose interest in each other. As two Air representatives they find that communication is the solution to any problem, but aren’t aware how far from Earth they might get with their ideas unrealized and their goals unreached because of too much talk, and too little action."},"Emotions":{"Value":40,"Description":"We could say that Gemini and Aquarius understand each other perfectly when it comes to their emotions. Usually this is true, but that doesn’t mean this is what they both need. The unstable nature of Gemini can make them change their mind or their emotional state on a daily basis, and if they don’t feel good in a relationship, they will set themselves free without overthinking the reasons why they had to do so. Aquarius is always in a rush to set themselves free from anyone or anything, so a breakup wouldn’t really be something strange in their world.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn most cases, their rational, mental natures will complement each other in an exciting way, but there is not much emotion to be built in the core of their relationship. It seems that both of these partners need to find someone a bit warmer in order to feel things more deeply and light their passionate hearts. They will much more often become friends than lovers, even if they were attracted to each other when they first met."},"Values":{"Value":95,"Description":"Suffice it to say that they both value intellect. The rest is just something that other signs worry about. However, Aquarius can be very passionate about their humane beliefs and will often support them strongly. This is something Gemini can understand but rarely supports. Because of the fact that Aquarius partner values equality of the people as much as their own freedom, this can be their point of separation, even though Gemini partner does not really disagree."},"Activities":{"Value":99,"Description":"Aquarius is the only sign capable to really surprise Gemini. They are so different than everyone else and represent a step that Gemini should climb if they want their life to be unbelievable. This is not always the case because some of the Aquarius’ weirdness can be a show off, designed by their need to mend their turbulent Sun. Still, it is exciting for them both to enter this relationship – Aquarius to surprise and Gemini to follow them wherever they go. Their main activity to be shared is movement. They could drive thousands of miles just to find a specific ice cream or for no reason at all. Mostly they can do anything together, from travelling and clubbing, to reading labels and instructions on the use of different kitchenware."},"Summary":{"Value":85,"Description":"Gemini needs a partner who doesn’t bore them or make them feel inhibited. When you look at things this way, you could say that there is no better match for them than the fabulous Aquarius. Aquarius needs someone to understand their grandiose ideas and discuss each one with them, and also someone who doesn’t make them feel inhibited. Who could do this better than Gemini? However, they could find themselves in a relationship that doesn’t have enough emotion and compassion, and this is certain to surface as soon as the first disturbing thing happens in the life of one of these partners. They need to work on their emotional base and their non-verbal understanding if they want their relationship to last."}},"Pisces":{"Love":{"Value":15,"Description":"It is a good thing there is so much creativity to Gemini’s approach to sex, or they would really have difficulty making any sort of intimate connection with Pisces. They can be attracted to each other due to the fact that they are ruled by Mercury and Jupiter, the same planets that rule their opposing signs. Still, there is a big chance they won’t even recognize each other as sexual beings or keep a distance from each other if they do.\\r\\n\\r\\nGemini has a lot of creative potential, but isn’t exactly in search for their one and only true love in order to have sex. Pisces, on the other hand, exalt Venus, and they only want to have sex with the love of their life, unless they’ve been disappointed too many times. If they meet after these numerous disappointments, Gemini will not find Pisces very attractive, for they will no longer have any childish energy or charm.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf their sex life is supposed to be functional, both of them will have to find a way to be a bit more grounded than they normally are. Gemini will have to realize the truth behind their own emotional nature and give in to true intimacy, while Pisces will have to accept the differences of their partner instead of searching for a soulmate with predefined qualities."},"Trust":{"Value":1,"Description":"Trust is already a weak spot in almost every relationship these two can have and when they get together, there is a chance they will have no idea how to create any trust between them. They have completely different ways of dealing with their emotional relationships and their issues with self-image, and they will think of many different ways to bend the truth when they are together. Unfortunately, when any of them lies, they won’t have much success. Gemini is too smart to be lied to by their Pisces partner, and Pisces sense their Gemini partner’s state too well to not realize when they’re not telling the truth. Basically they both dip into each other’s unconscious and see each other in the way that none of them looks at themselves.\\r\\n"},"Intellect":{"Value":20,"Description":"There is always a fairytale or two to share between them and some fun to have when they go out. They will laugh together, but this is a strange connection with a lack of real communication. Gemini can decide to make a joke and Pisces will laugh without really thinking about it. Pisces will then say something to poke their Gemini and Gemini will laugh without thinking about it. It is as if they never really listen to each other and sink into a strange pool of superficial relationships and small talk.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they start discussing their deep thoughts and feelings, they might end up in a conflict that none of them anticipated. We could say that they idealize each other, but only to a point of recognition. Neither Gemini nor Pisces will think of each other as their one true love unless they really are each other’s one true love. So they will have this image of each other that is deviated from reality, due to the fact they don’t really listen to each other. The only possible way for them to have a conversation with depth is in a situation in which they have absolute emotional intimacy, such as family members usually have."},"Emotions":{"Value":1,"Description":"Gemini is one of the most rational signs in the zodiac and Pisces is the cureless romantic and one of the most emotional signs. When they do fall in love, they are rarely on the same frequency and often only one of them has true emotions for the other. They represent ideal candidates for an unreturned love scenario and can be a nuisance to everyone around them if they end up in a relationship with no emotional balance."},"Values":{"Value":5,"Description":"They both value what they stand for and although Gemini values someone to listen to them and love them unconditionally, this is not the same as the passionate love Pisces partner wants to have. In general, they will both hold on to what they know best and Gemini will value intellectual strength and won’t get very disturbed by dishonesty for as long as their image of a relationship isn’t disturbed. Pisces will value their partner’s reliability and trust is very high on their list of priorities.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, there is one thing they will share, hidden in the fact that they both value someone’s ability to create. Even though this comes out of different views on creation, it can bond them in the act of creativity. Pisces would provide talent and inspiration and Gemini their resourcefulness and practicality."},"Activities":{"Value":15,"Description":"When we speak of Gemini and Pisces, we have to keep in mind that both signs are mutable. Although their interests might differ greatly, they could find activities to share due to their mutual need for movement of any kind. Pisces will normally dream about movement rather than actually move and this is exactly what their Gemini could teach them – how to make the first step."},"Summary":{"Value":10,"Description":"Gemini and Pisces are squaring signs that often don’t have that much in common. They are both usually positive enough to have a superficial enjoyable relationship and go well together at large social gatherings. They could both forget to call each other when they agreed to, and they can both change their opinions in two seconds, but they simply don’t share the same goals. As a strongly mental and a strongly emotional sign, their lack of understanding can be hurtful for Pisces and sometimes for both of them. If they do fall in love and start a romantic relationship, chances are they will not last very long.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, there is a beauty in the creative side of this relationship and if Gemini decides to truly listen to Pisces, they could help them use their talent in a constructive way. In most situations Pisces will just drain the energy out of their Gemini partner, especially if they end up in their fragile, needy mode that some other signs could understand much better than Gemini. If they are to succeed in their persistence to be together, they should work together and socialize a lot. The most important thing for both of them in this relationship is to reach for their emotional cores and give in to true intimacy, or they will never manage to communicate."}}},"Cancer":{"Aries":{"Love":{"Value":70,"Description":"We usually see the sign of Cancer as extremely asexual. Our family is presented by the sign of Cancer and the Moon, and it is a psychological challenge for all of us to understand that our parents are sexual beings. This would be fine if the members of this universal Cancer family weren’t convinced in their asexual nature as well. Their emotional characteristics allow only for sexual relationships with meaning and enough tenderness. Only when they meet the right person to set them free, they come to learn about the other aspects of their sexuality.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem with sexual relations with an Aries is that Aries partners are usually not that gentle to begin with. They need to learn to show emotion. For them intimacy is something built, not implied. If they manage to reconcile these huge differences at the beginning of their relationship and if none of them is forced to do anything they are not ready for, their attraction to each other should do the trick and their sexual relationship could become truly sensual and exciting for both of them."},"Trust":{"Value":50,"Description":"The issue of trust is something different for this couple. They will rarely debate about their trust in each other’s fidelity. Usually the problem they encounter is a trust issue when it comes to intimacy. Aries has a different view on intimacy. In the eyes of their Cancer partner they can seem pushy and even aggressive with an attitude that doesn’t lead to anything close to relaxed. As much as Cancer would like to understand the straightforward nature of Aries, it will be extremely difficult to see it as anything other than beastly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is also a problem with the way they show and recognize emotions. It may be hard for an Aries partner to understand that they are loved if someone only asks annoying questions, tries to tie them down and doesn’t want to have sex. On the other hand, Cancer will probably feel violated in every way, unless Aries partner slows down and has an atypical show of gentle emotions. Usually any sort of mistrust is a consequence of the lack of ability to believe in each other’s feelings for one another, for they don’t really recognize them well."},"Intellect":{"Value":20,"Description":"Both of these partners have the same tendency to act on an impulse and cut the conversation short before they even got to the point of it. It is not their intention to react in this way, but they push each other’s buttons and it is very hard for them to stay focused and solve the issue they talked about. Their interests differ too much, so even when they are trying to have a peaceful conversation about something impersonal, it is still a battle to keep the attention to the subject in question, whoever initiated the talk.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir only shared characteristic is the cardinal quality of both signs, which gives them a good understanding on each other’s “ad hoc” personalities. This will make it easier for the couple to recover from all of the possible conflicts and misunderstandings. Still, in the eyes of a Cancer partner, this type of relationship doesn’t have a purpose and they might find themselves fighting in a way they don’t feel comfortable with.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs their signs are ruled by Mars and the Moon, it is an archetypal story of hurt and emotional pain, so their intentions have to be truly pure. They have to treat each other in a gentle, thought-out way, measuring every word they say. This can be exhausting for both of them, unless they fully accept the fact that they don’t need to change their personality, only the way they express it and make a game out of it."},"Emotions":{"Value":70,"Description":"Aries and Cancer are both deeply emotional, although Aries is often described as if they had an emotional disability. They are warm, passionate and have high expectations of their partner when it comes to scratching beneath the surface. Their boundaries may be too strict as they fear their own sensitivity and sometimes act like heartless soldiers. Cancer wears their emotions as a winter coat and hides them only when feeling ashamed to show them. They accept their emotional nature as a given and work toward realizing a personal world full of respect for their soft side. We often say that Cancer wants to have a family and raise children, but this is not due to their need to reproduce or stay in the house all day long, but because they need a safe haven for their emotional side and enough people to share their compassionate nature with.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven though these approaches to their emotions seem different, they understand each other’s depth and in most cases respect each other in this area of existence, in case Aries leaves their impatient nature out of their relationship. The problem appears when they are supposed to understand how they feel about each other, as feelings are not easily shown when dealing with partner’s personality they don’t fully understand."},"Values":{"Value":40,"Description":"While Aries gives a lot of significance to someone’s state of energy, focus and consistency, Cancer values the ability to stay rational and stable, qualities they have a difficulty achieving, or being in a state of emotional balance. Their values aren’t even connected, except for the fact they both have the idea that some sort of future balance, that can be quite hard to achieve, would make them better.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Activities":{"Value":30,"Description":"As much as Aries wants to devote to their physical body, sports and all the ways to keep their creative energy high, Cancer wants to sleep, dance and eat all they long. Mostly they share sexual activities and the time for rest, since Cancer probably has no intention of following that insane Aries pace.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Summary":{"Value":47,"Description":"This relationship can be painful for both partners and needs a lot of work put into it in order to work. It requires both of the partners to adapt and make changes in their behavior, while tip toing around each other most of the time. It is not an easy road, but the rewards are such inner understanding of passion, full of emotion and the ability to create something truly unique. If they succeed, they will probably never be satisfied with a different partner."}},"Taurus":{"Love":{"Value":95,"Description":"Someone might think that Taurus and Cancer are two of the most asexual signs in the entire zodiac. This is an instinctive assumption based on the fact that both signs don’t care for Mars very much, meaning they don’t care for instinctive sex. They would probably never have the urge to have sex just for the sake of it, but this doesn’t in any case mean they are asexual.\\r\\n\\r\\nTaurus is a sign of physical pleasure. Ruled by Venus, the planet of feminine sexuality, Taurus needs to approach their sexual experiences with the same studiousness with which they would approach any other thing in their life. They need to see, touch, smell, feel everything on their partner’s body and enjoy making them satisfied. With Cancer’s need for closeness and the lack of ability to make their sexual life light and carefree, Taurus seems to have the perfect touch to relax them and build trust within their sexual relationship.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the lack of Mars comes the lack of initiative, and this could be their problem when it comes to sex. In case they both don’t have a sexual drive stronger than their love for food, they could end up in an asexual relationship, in which they would lie around the house, cook, eat and gain weight all day long."},"Trust":{"Value":99,"Description":"When Taurus and Cancer fall in love with each other, they base their entire relationship on the feel of their partner. There is not much that can be hidden from this sensitive, “sixth” sense these two can share when they connect. It would take a lot to break their trust and this would certainly mean the end of their relationship. In most situations, none of them has the need to betray their partner, for their goal is the same – love, family and home.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Intellect":{"Value":80,"Description":"They share lots of different interests and will easily talk about their relationship. Neither of these signs talks much, but they are perfectly capable of understanding each other’s silence and give each word a lot of significance. Their most common topics would include love, home and children, except when they feel unready or when they are too young. It is important to understand that these are not the only issues on their minds, though. Whatever their current interests, they will communicate it in a slow, sensitive manner, leading a conversation to a point of deep mutual understanding.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, Taurus can be truly stubborn at times. It doesn’t really matter if they are right or not, for they simply close up for any further conversation as soon as one of their true convictions is touched. Cancer can’t really do that much when this happens. They can try and be even more gentle and compassionate. In case they are close to enlightened, this will certainly work. If not, they will get really emotional and discover that their Taurus partner in fact drives them crazy. As a result, Taurus will see their partner as a real lunatic, waving their hands for no reason and showing no rational behavior whatsoever."},"Emotions":{"Value":99,"Description":"Taurus and Cancer are the rulers of the entire warm, earthly emotional world. It is not just due to their sensitivity, but the combination of their emotional expression is something almost unimaginable. While Cancer feels, senses and takes care of their Taurus partner in the emotional realm, Taurus will give love back through physical tenderness, material security and the gentle touch of practical sense that Cancer needs. When this cycle happens several times, their love seems like a chain reaction that will never stop growing.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they meet in supporting circumstances, when they don’t need to fight for each other or the possibility of their love, every emotion should simply build up on the previous one and things between them should run smoothly. But if they stumble upon an obstacle of any kind, before their love for each other develops, they will probably be discouraged and never discover what they might have felt if only they fought for one another. If they do fall in love, they will not lack the energy to fight for their relationship, no matter the obstacles.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Values":{"Value":80,"Description":"Most of all, they both value life and peace. Since the Moon is the ruler of the sign of Cancer and exalted in Taurus, they both deeply value all things the Moon represents – family, compassion, understanding and bliss.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, there can be a certain divergence in their view of the material world. Cancer is a Water sign, much more focused on the value of emotion, while Taurus will be turned to financial security. This usually reflects the fear Taurus feels when it comes to their material existence being in question. In the eyes of Cancer this may seem superficial for they have a tendency to think of material reality in an idealistic way. If they have a family together, these issues should settle, because the love of Cancer partner to their children combined with their desire to give them everything they need, easily shifts their perspective and teaches them about the true value of money.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Activities":{"Value":90,"Description":"We could say that they might share every single activity any of them thinks of, but this is not that often called an “activity”. Most of the time and especially if they both have demanding jobs, they will simply share the activity of sleeping, eating or doing nothing. This is not a question of laziness, but more of an exaggerated need for the pleasure of rest. When shared, it seems to multiply and grow beyond both of their rational minds."},"Summary":{"Value":91,"Description":"Taurus and Cancer present the gentlest couple of the zodiac. When they fall in love, they will rarely find the reason to separate, because of their shared emotional goals for love, understanding, family and the feeling of home. This is the relationship that seems like a perpetuum mobile of love, in case both partners don’t already have too much emotional baggage that makes them unable to give and receive this depth of emotion. Even if they do, with no obstacles on the way, they will likely learn to forgive and forget as the flow of their relationship takes them to what they always desired.\\r\\n\\r\\n"}},"Gemini":{"Love":{"Value":5,"Description":"Gemini would go outside and have the weirdest sexual experiences, and Cancer would stay at home and wait for the night to be loved by their tender partner. This is not always the case, of course, but it is very rare for a Gemini partner to manage to relax their Cancer and make them join their sexual adventure. Still, there is a link between them, pretty strong for that matter. Cancer continues the sign of Gemini, and in a way their nature is a consequence of endless conversations and rational explanations.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Gemini partner has enough patience to talk to their partner about same things over and over, in time they could build enough intimacy to have a good sex life. In order for this scenario to develop, Cancer needs to talk, too. It will not be enough to say a sentence or two and expect that their Gemini will understand how they feel. If they manage to communicate, Cancer could actually wake the depth of their Gemini, giving them enough support to express their more emotional sexual personality.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they want their relationship to work, their sex life needs to be somewhere in the middle – intimate enough and exciting enough – for both partners to be satisfied."},"Trust":{"Value":25,"Description":"Gemini is a sign ruled by Mercury, our little trickster. It is not easy to trust a Gemini partner, especially if one is trying to take away their freedom. As a rational sign, they usually find no reason to lie or cheat on their partner, for as long as they don’t feel threatened by intimacy they are not ready for, or tied down.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe major task of Cancer in a relationship with Gemini is to let them be free. If they start living together, Gemini will have to stay out of their love nest and Cancer will spend a lot of time alone. This is a challenge, but both signs can have enough dedication to their personal values, and these partners should know better than to ruin their relationship with trivial lies."},"Intellect":{"Value":70,"Description":"\\"There is probably not a single sign in the zodiac that Gemini couldn’t talk to, so their communication skills mark this category a bit higher in every case. In their relation to a Cancer partner, they usually feel the need to open up a bit more and share things that they wouldn’t with other people. There is a certain “motherly” glow around Cancer, male or female, that gives Gemini enough room to set their inner child free.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis can actually be a wonderful relationship that lasts much longer than other Gemini relationships, because there is usually enough understanding in Cancer for their childlike partner. That is, if other aspects of the relationship are satisfying enough. It is safe to say that Cancer and Gemini make good friends and this could give a push in the right direction toward their emotional and sexual understanding as well.\\""},"Emotions":{"Value":10,"Description":"The main negative possibility here would be in the fact that Gemini doesn’t always listen. It is often said that Gemini is a superficial sign, but in fact, they like to stay afloat and keep away from difficult conversations because of their need to move forward. Cancer can try to share their emotions too often for Gemini to have enough patience to understand them, and this can be devastating for their emotional relationship.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, Gemini doesn’t really show emotions in a way that Cancer will easily recognize. It is a good thing they are capable of finding emotion in anything and anyone, so they might have a chance to understand the emotional nature of their childish Gemini."},"Values":{"Value":1,"Description":"They have completely different systems in which they value things in life. While Gemini is a rational sign, giving value to all that comes out of their mind, Cancer is an emotional guru, giving value to things their heart beats for. When it comes to relationships, they are probably the most vulnerable to differences in this category, for differences here make their primary goals different. Although they will both be motivated to find love, the way their partner acts in a relationship could be considered “wrong” due to its opposite nature from what each of them values."},"Activities":{"Value":15,"Description":"Activities Gemini and Cancer could share mainly depend on the energy level of Cancer partner. If they have enough of it to follow Gemini’s chaotic schedule, they could find a lot of enjoyable things to do together. Cancer is a sign that exalts Jupiter, and its representatives like to travel, as much as they like to feel at home due to the sign itself. Although Gemini partner doesn’t really have to go that far, they could find middle ground in travelling to places they both want to visit.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the main characteristic of Gemini is their curiosity. It will lead them in all directions, they will feel the need to try everything and find more new, exciting experiences to share with someone. Unfortunately Cancer doesn’t really enjoy this that much. While the relationship is new, it will all seem exciting and breathtaking. As time passes, Cancer will want to settle down, imagining them buying furniture together and raising children. It is not easy for them to accept that this nature Gemini has isn’t something that will be different tomorrow. There is no settling down with a Gemini partner. This is just not their mission in life."},"Summary":{"Value":21,"Description":"Gemini and Cancer are next to each other in the zodiac, and they are likely to be next to each other in friendship. When it comes to emotional or sexual relationships, there seems to be too many things that set them apart. In order for their relationship to last, they both need to make some adjustments. Gemini will hardly ever change their routine for someone, especially when they find someone’s way of life boring, so the best thing to do here is to give them their freedom. If Cancer falls in love deeply enough, they will understand what their Gemini partner needs, and won’t hold them back even if they wished for them to be different.\\r\\n\\r\\nGemini partner has to open their heart and listen to those few words that Cancer wants to share. Even though they can speak about many things, when it comes to discussions of their relationship, their views on it are different. Gemini needs to keep it interesting and Cancer needs to be heard, as much as felt. If they give each other enough freedom and understanding, they could be like children in love for the first time."}},"Cancer":{"Love":{"Value":65,"Description":"When it comes to intimacy, Cancer is a master of achieving it with the right person. If two Cancer truly find each other, they will reach for each other’s deepest emotional core within their sex life. Still, Cancer is a sign where Mars falls and it is not easy for them to have initiative. For a healthy sex life, Mars needs to be strong and these two don’t necessarily show this strength. This could lead to their emotional relationship blossoming, but no sexual chemistry between them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a good thing they both don’t need much experience or technical knowledge in their sexual encounters, because this gives them a chance to base their sex life exclusively on emotions they have for each other. It could be boring from the perspective of some other zodiac signs, but they really won’t care if they get the confirmation they are loved through their physical contact.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, they do need someone to wake them up, motivate them and push their limits. No Cancer will be satisfied with a boring emotional life, even though they might seem that way. They will fight for their family, for intimacy and their safe haven, but they will not settle for something that doesn’t excite them at all. In order for the relationship of two of them to succeed, it would be a good idea to experiment a little and show initiative at any time they feel the least bit sexual."},"Trust":{"Value":99,"Description":"Why not trust each other when they both don’t care about their ego being lifted by adultery, a younger partner or search for some impossible love story. Cancer is a well-grounded sign, for its ruler is exalted in Taurus. They want an emotional stability that can be felt in the material world and understand that there is no such thing as perfection. When they find a person they can see themselves with in years to come, they will accept their faults and make necessary compromises to build a loving family and a home for themselves. If two Cancers see each other in this way, they have no reason not to trust each other completely."},"Intellect":{"Value":90,"Description":"If you are looking for a fan of non-verbal communication, look for Cancer. When there are two of them, especially if they are in an intimate relationship, they can be quiet for days for as long as their inner feeling is good. Although they enjoy the routine of sharing some life details with their partner, their favorite time of day will probably be that cup of morning coffee when they don’t have to talk at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the more rational signs could have a low opinion on the intellectual strength of these partners and they could seem as if they have nothing to say. But anyone who is a bit more sensitive will feel that they look at each other with undivided attention and follow each other’s movements and grins. They don’t need words when they can smile to each other. Who cares about communication really? It can be so obsolete…"},"Emotions":{"Value":99,"Description":"Mostly Cancer is tagged as the most emotional sign of the zodiac. This is somewhat true, although the leading roles are divided by all of the Water signs. Cancer is the sign of family love and closeness, not so much the sensual, sexual love presented through Venus. When two Cancer representatives start a relationship, they will understand each other’s emotional states perfectly. There is an almost inevitable issue in their primary families that needs to be resolved, and they will usually use each other to do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they are both ruled by the Moon, their mood changes will probably coincide, but the scope of emotions that the Moon represents is far bigger than most of us presume. They carry emotional state of their ancestors and it is not enough to tag them as just “emotional”. The best relationship for two Cancer partners means to build a family, but only in case they have a good sex life. All of their emotions are best shared, understood and dealt with when they share a home and their life together.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Values":{"Value":99,"Description":"They will share the same values and understand each other perfectly in this segment of their relationship. Their similarity comes to focus right here, where they are free to value emotional clarity, peace and a calm, family life someone is able to create. This could keep them together in a loving relationship even if they maybe didn’t seem perfect for each other in the first place."},"Activities":{"Value":55,"Description":"As two Cancer partners they don’t have a problem to share any activity, but they could realize that they have a problem starting one. While their relationship is new and everything is exciting, they will both share their ideas on things they could do together, probably things from their individual routines. When the relationship settles, they might find themselves in stagnation, not moving at all, just because of their passive natures that have a tendency to spend a cozy evening at home."},"Summary":{"Value":85,"Description":"Cancer is a sign of genetic inheritance and it is sometimes difficult to reconcile the genetic predispositions of two Cancer partners. However, their mellow nature, ability to feel and have enough compassion for each other, makes them great candidates for marriage, children and the whole picket fence scenario.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir sex life and their shared activities could suffer a general lack of initiative, energy and movement. Because of this, they should both try not to end up in a boring everyday routine in which they only eat and sit in front of a TV as soon as they come home from work. It is important for them to have enough tender surprises and activities that build their physical relationship, or they might end up unsatisfied and not really understanding why. If they are troubled by this possible shortcoming of their relationship, as two tender individuals, they will manage to make each other feel wonderful, even if that means breaking up."}},"Leo":{"Love":{"Value":30,"Description":"Cancer and Leo make a very interesting couple due to the fact they are the only signs in the zodiac ruled by the lights in the sky, both of which are not planets – the Sun and the Moon. Although they don’t have much in common, in astrology they represent a husband and a wife and are the king and queen of the zodiac. Unfortunately we know how unsatisfying the sex between a king and a queen can be like.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexual aspect of their relationship depends on the depth of their emotions. As highly emotional signs, each in their own way, they tend to show their love in different ways and this can be a bit hard to reconcile in their sex life. As a Fire sign, Leo is way more openly passionate and this could scare their Cancer away. Cancer is tender and sensitive enough to make their Leo partner feel guilty because of their nature, or Leo could simply have difficulty being tender in the way Cancer needs them to. It is as if a lion and a roe started a sexual relationship and although they don’t want to hurt each other, their primal behavior seems to pull them in that direction.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, because of their rulers, they can get pretty close and share fine emotions in their sexual encounters. Although there won’t be much excitement to them, they could be satisfying enough for both partners if they don’t expect a wild sex life. To find middle ground they really need to be quiet and listen to each other’s needs."},"Trust":{"Value":50,"Description":"It is said that Leo likes to be in the center of everyone’s attention. This is somewhat true and Leo is a born performer, more or less supported to become one. However, their need to show off is something Cancer might find irritating, but not something to lose their trust over. If Cancer feels loved, they have no reason to doubt their partner just because of their nature. Still, the differences between them might lead to a secret search for more compatible partners and this is easily sensed by both partners."},"Intellect":{"Value":10,"Description":"Cancer and Leo, ruled by the Moon and the Sun, represent a subconscious and a conscious mind. Even if they share interests, they will often have a strangely different view on the same thing. They will often just drift apart as the conversation progresses. The Moon does reflect the light of the Sun, but it circles around the Earth. This would be fine if the Sun wasn’t so used to the fact that everyone circles around it. This explains what happens in their relationship once Leo starts talking. Although they shine, Cancer pays much more attention to someone else or to the idea of earthly things they could have together, than to their Leo partner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe base of their communication should be in things that have yet to be discovered. All the mysteries that are there to be solved could be a good starting point because they both need to understand things, each in their own area of dominance. The best possibility they have is in the things that need a light cast on them from two different angles. If they have enough respect for each other, they could learn a lot from each other’s passive and active approach to life."},"Emotions":{"Value":45,"Description":"We can say with certainty that their emotions are a truly beautiful thing. Both signs represent love and although it is not the same kind of love, it is an emotion, pure and simple. Cancer is a Water sign that represent motherly love and all emotions in one’s family. Although this is not always a promise of happiness, the depth of all the love that hides within is magical. On the other hand, Leo is a Fire sign of joy, first loves, fun and sex. Their heart is warm and big, for Leo represents our inner child, and their loyalty is unchangeable when they decide to give it to someone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main problem here is their connection, for Cancer needs to look into somebody’s eyes and feel the love, while Leo wants to shout it out from the rooftops. This could seem untrue to Cancer, as much as Leo could recognize in Cancer something that would rather tie them down than allow them to fly. Both of them have opposing signs ruled traditionally by Saturn and this is exactly why they could recognize true quality in their relationship, as each of them takes their opposing role to learn something. Usually this is not something that can last very long and they will probably both move on to find someone who is more of an image from their seventh house.\\r\\n"},"Values":{"Value":1,"Description":"They simply don’t value the same things. Although this is the point where they separate their ways, it usually takes them long to realize this fact. Cancer values tenderness, emotions, family and a stable life with someone, while Leo values initiative, passion, energy and focus. There is rarely something that they will both value in the same way, or put in the same spot at their priority lists."},"Activities":{"Value":35,"Description":"It helps that Leo would gladly sleep for 20 hours a day. This will make them available at home. They will also gladly be served by breakfast, lunch and dinner, and who better to prepare those than a caring Cancer. However, when they leave the house, they will want to visit different places. Cancer will want to visit their close friends, especially if they have babies, go for a walk by the lake or have a romantic evening at the movies. Whatever they do, they like it with a little intimacy to it. As if to oppose this, Leo will want to spend time at places where they could be seen. Their partner needs to shine to others and hold them by the hand while everyone else claps theirs. This is not often something Cancer will be ready to do, as they don’t really like to be the center of attention. On the other hand, Leo could compromise, but in the end they wouldn’t be happy if their social needs aren’t met."},"Summary":{"Value":29,"Description":"Although the Moon reflects the light from the Sun, the sign of Cancer doesn’t really see Leo as the source of all their joy. Leo is a sign that should spread joy and love with an active approach to each one of their relationships. How is it possible that Cancer is immune? Well probably because the Moon circles around the Earth, not the Sun.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey are special, that’s for sure. Both of them are strong individuals, each on their own plane. Their lack of understanding and emotional touch can be explained through the fact that both of them have a mission to spread love to the less fortunate signs of the zodiac. Not everyone is born with an emotional flow like Cancer and a huge, warm heart like Leo. If they kept all this love to themselves, some unfortunate souls would probably search for them aimlessly, and the world would be a much sadder place."}},"Virgo":{"Love":{"Value":95,"Description":"When Cancer and Virgo get together, there is potential for a great, everlasting love. They have a possibility to become an inspirational contact of heart and mind, if only they give in to the opportunity to enter each other’s worlds.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir sexual relationship seems to be a lecture on emotion. The sign of Virgo brings Venus to its fall and suffers from a general lack of emotion. It is a rational sign with a lot to analyze, that rarely gives in to the first impulse or their fragile emotional state. They are to learn on how to feel safe enough to let their guard down and shut their mind off in order to feel and enjoy sex. Cancer doesn’t really understand how someone could have trouble getting in touch with their emotions and can have unrealistic expectations because of this. They will learn to understand their partner better and make a stronger sexual bond, realizing how different people can be."},"Trust":{"Value":99,"Description":"If someone can help Virgo build their trust, it is their Cancer partner. Although Cancer is a cardinal sign, they are stable by nature, especially when it comes to emotional decisions they have made. If they have chosen Virgo to be their loving partner, they will have no reason to lie or cheat. This behavior would only endanger their vision of a shared life and a loving family they want with the partner they chose. This is also a reason why Cancer won’t have an initial problem with trusting Virgo. Their convictions are stronger than their doubt."},"Intellect":{"Value":80,"Description":"They are ruled by the same planet, master of communication, Mercury. They may have their differences, but we wouldn’t say their communication is bad. Even if they have a fight, they will still be good at talking. Their view on intellect could be a bit different though. Gemini’s superficial nature could seem extremely stupid to their Virgo partner. This will set Gemini off to be even more irritating on purpose, because they are everything but stupid. In return, Gemini will see Virgo’s obsession with details and think of them as crazy. Virgo will probably not fight this, but sit in their room and cry, alone, in the dark.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey need to find a way to recognize each other’s “flaws” as good qualities and they will get there if each of them lets their partner help. When these minds come together, there is no problem to stay unsolved, for together, they are Mercury in all its glory. These signs have a mission to unite and transform heavenly ideas into real life, and lift human knowledge step by step, towards divinity. This is a relationship of the Air side of Mercury and its Earth side, grounded and well thought of. It shouldn’t be forgotten that the sign of Virgo exalts Mercury so Virgo can exalt their Gemini partner, if only they wanted to land."},"Emotions":{"Value":65,"Description":"The rational side of Virgo could keep their overall emotional status very low. If Cancer starts showing their emotions openly and with no restriction, Virgo might get scared and start analyzing every little thing to determine if any emotion is really there. There is probably no greater turn off for a Cancer than someone who rationalizes their own emotion. As if the fight to keep them afloat among the human race isn’t enough, now they have to deal with a neurotic partner who dismisses them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe emotional side to Virgo is a deeply feminine side, usually ashamed to show her face, especially if Virgo partner is male. It becomes almost impossible for them to feel something if they are in any way pressured or feel mistrust with their partner. Virgo would rather be alone, with a right book, than with the wrong person, and it takes a lot of patience and rationality from their partner if they want to understand and wait for the ice to melt. If Cancer manages to do this, there is no reason for both of them not to resolve any other emotional issue that needs resolving, mutual or individual, while together."},"Values":{"Value":50,"Description":"If they form a truly functional and beautiful relationship, they will value each other. To Virgo, their Cancer partner will seem much more down to earth and rational than they are, and to Cancer, their Virgo partner will have a recognized soft spot in their heart. Other things won’t matter much when they find each other, because there is no compromise they both wouldn’t make to keep this love going. However, their different values might represent an obstacle to them getting to this point in a relationship. As a deeply emotional and the most intelligent sign in the zodiac, one of them values family, love and understanding, and the other intellect, attention to detail and their health. It is not like they don’t have a meeting point, but it will not be easily found if they both stubbornly keep to their habits and opinions."},"Activities":{"Value":90,"Description":"Although Virgo is a mutable sign and they can be pretty hard to follow, they do belong to the element of Earth and will be capable to wait for their Cancer partner to decide whether they will want to join them or not. This is very often a relationship of two people who can manage without each other, so they will not be bound by shared activities as much as some other signs might be. If one of them wants to do something, unless truly insecure, they won’t take it as a personal insult if their partner doesn’t want to do the same thing. This is where their rational compatibility will really come in handy, as they make arrangements for their time together.\\r\\n\\r\\nUsually there will be just enough movement and romance for both of them to feel special, and this is certainly not the main concern in their relationship. After all, they would both gladly go to a movie and eat some popcorn, so there is always something they can do together, even if their needs are very different.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Summary":{"Value":77,"Description":"Cancer and Virgo can have a wonderful connection and are usually brought together by sexual understanding. The main problem of their relationship is in the possible conflict between emotional Cancer and reasonable Virgo. If they manage to overcome this, accepting each other’s shortcomings and learning to incorporate some rationality or some emotion into their lives, they could end up in an inspiring relationship that will last for a very long time. In a way, they complement each other as much as the heart complements the mind. If they share a spark of love, it would be a shame to miss the opportunity for happiness just because of someone’s irrational expectations or someone’s closed heart.\\r\\n\\r\\n"}},"Libra":{"Love":{"Value":40,"Description":"At first glance Cancer and Libra might seem as if they are really far apart. Both signs have trouble accepting Mars and this leads to a lack of passion and initiative in their sex life. However, the tactful and careful nature of Libra can really soothe Cancer. This is mostly because of the fact that Saturn, the ruler of Cancer’s opposing sign, is exalted in Libra. Although some initiative might be lacking, there is a chance for Cancer and Libra to function very well in their sex life if they spend enough time together.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem with their sexual connection is in their element, more than anything else. Cancer belongs to the element of Water and Libra is an Air sign. Although Libra partner might be extremely patient and nice, there is still a speed to the element of Air that Cancer might have trouble adjusting to.\\r\\n\\r\\nThings they would like to try out will differ greatly, for Cancer needs emotional connection and Libra needs contact, touch and experience before they get too emotional. Libra is not often inspired by the nature of Cancer and won’t normally fall in love with them at first sight. Their sex life can be very good if they already share deep emotions, so it would be best if they started a relationship out of friendship, already knowing each other to some point and sharing some feelings besides possible attraction.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Trust":{"Value":30,"Description":"Cancer can be one of the most trusting zodiac signs, but there is an irritating side to Libra’s nature that they rarely stay immune to. While Cancer wants a quiet family life with no interference from other people, Libra can’t seem to stay away from other people, seeking their affection and approval day after day. At some point their Cancer partner has to ask themselves if this is the kind of partner they want to have children with. On the other hand, Libra finds the whole approach to a romantic relationship Cancer has a bit unrealistic. This can easily lead to a lack of trust in Libra, especially if the Sun is in final degrees of the sign."},"Intellect":{"Value":50,"Description":"As signs ruled by Venus and the Moon, it is safe to presume that their relationship is in a way very important. Although Libra is in charge for the upper, spiritual nature of Venus, it is still a sign of relationships and the Moon will only emphasize the need for closeness and harmony. Their communication will not be too difficult, but there is a chance they won’t share many interests or respect each other enough for it to have true quality.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir main problem could surface if they start making unrealistic plans together. The expectations of Cancer with Capricorn as their opposing sign would be extremely practical and strict. Libra does exalt Saturn, but it is not an Earth sign, and usually they remain in the field of ideas instead of a practical approach to materialization. Cancer doesn’t understand how someone can be so far from reality and this could lead to a strange passive conflict that could endanger their entire relationship. Cancer needs to realize that Libra has its place among the Air signs, in the field of ideas - not necessarily their realization.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is important to remember that Libra has a troubled Sun and usually looks for a partner with more fire and passionate energy than Cancer normally has. However ugly that might sound, they need someone to feed on, and they normally have strong relationships with fire signs which produce enough energy even for their loved ones, or Air signs who don’t really care about it. The sign of Cancer unconsciously calculates and distributes energy to their inner priority list, and they will rarely have an excess big enough to shower Libra in it."},"Emotions":{"Value":15,"Description":"Both Moon and Venus represent emotions, and they are both highly emotional signs. However, their emotional context is very different, for Cancer is looking for a love on Earth and Libra is looking for someone to take to heaven. This is exactly where the spiritual side of Libra’s Venus takes away their true chance to share a life together. It is a Venus that doesn’t need to eat or sleep, for as long as it feels the unique, balanced love. Cancer will understand this idea to some point, but probably look for a more grounded partner when they realize that this is a pattern that isn’t about to change.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs two cardinal signs, they could have a long unsatisfying relationship because they are both waiting for a groundbreaking moment to set them free. In some cases they should be advised to make a change if they are not satisfied, and search for someone who could make them happier."},"Values":{"Value":20,"Description":"As both of them are signs of relationships – family relationships or relationships with partners – they will both value a pleasant and joyful connection between two people. If they find it with each other, they will certainly have trouble letting it go, both of them understanding that it is not that easy to find. However, their entire system of values differs greatly beyond the point of relationships, and while Cancer will value tenderness and care, Libra will value responsibility and platonic love. That doesn\'t sound promising, does it?"},"Activities":{"Value":10,"Description":"Cancer and Libra could do many things together, but it is questionable if they will want to. Cancer is a sign that exalts Jupiter and although they can be perfectly happy with a grumpy partner, they would appreciate them not to have a need to impose their grumpiness on them. There is a secret desire to every Cancer to travel the world, while having the safe base to come home to, but Libra could destruct their beliefs and lead them to doubt they simply don’t want to deal with. With Cancer’s mild and mellow temperament, Libra will probably feel even more inadequate and grumpy, for they need someone to be their opposition and defy them in order to have respect and sexual charge.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Summary":{"Value":28,"Description":"Probably the biggest restriction in the relationship between Cancer and Libra is in things they want from their partner. Cancer wants someone responsible, to take them by the hand if needed and complement their emotional nature with practicality. Libra wants someone who is full of life, energized, strong and full of initiative to follow their ideas. They can really disappoint each other if any expectations are set wrongly at the beginning of their relationship. The best way for them to build a love that is to last, is for both partners to hold on to their independence whatever happens. If they focus on love and worry about earthly things each on their own, Cancer could “compromise” on heavenly love, as much as Libra would like to have a family."}},"Scorpio":{"Love":{"Value":90,"Description":"The sign of Scorpio is associated with death and all kinds of bad things, but all of their maliciousness comes from their emotional and sexual repression. Cancer can usually understand the need of their Scorpio partner to express their deepest, darkest emotions in their sex life. If Cancer partner doesn’t get scared or too forced to do something they are not ready for, a sexual relationship between Cancer and Scorpio can be deeply satisfying for both partners.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a relationship of two Water signs and because of this their sex life needs to reflect all of their emotional connection or a lack of it if there is any. When they fall in love, they will both need to express their feelings and the intimacy they might share is incredible.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, Scorpio is a sign in which the Moon falls and this is the ruler of the sign of Cancer. If Scorpio’s need to bury their emotions is too intense, there is a great chance they will be too rough or insensitive on their partner. This is something Cancer will have difficulty coping with and could lead to Cancer’s need to separate because they could simply get tired from all the special or aggressive sexual requirements their Scorpio partner has."},"Trust":{"Value":95,"Description":"When Scorpio falls in love, trust is one of the most important things they are looking for. If they feel betrayed in any way, they can start showing all of those maleficent sides of their nature and become truly possessive and jealous. Cancer partner usually wants someone to share a life with and they will have no reason to cheat or lie to their partner.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs all water signs, they could both fear telling the truth to a certain point, but this doesn’t necessarily need to speak of their unfaithfulness or the beginning of the end of their relationship. Usually they will both be able to give each other enough security to feel safe and build the trust they both need not to feel hurt or betrayed.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Intellect":{"Value":99,"Description":"Cancer and Scorpio usually understand each other without words. This can influence their sex life and make it much better, or much worse, depending on how their need for mystery is expressed. Their communication is very good, for as long as emotions are not the main theme of a conversation. They can finish each other’s sentences if they have any need to talk in the first place. The depth they both have, although it might not be visible at first in Cancer partner, makes them able to talk about anything at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the case when Cancer wants to run from negative experiences and Scorpio from their emotions, they could have trouble forming a relationship at all. Still, this is a very rare scenario and even if they have these tendencies, they will probably help each other deal with them and give each other the exact mental stimulation they both need.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Emotions":{"Value":70,"Description":"This is a tricky territory for a couple like this one. Cancer lives buried in their emotions, positive or negative, capable of using them in their everyday routine as an incorporated part of their life. Scorpio can have trouble understanding how this works exactly, because they have a tendency to dismiss emotions, thinking that this is the only way to reach a certain goal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe middle ground they need to find is a place where they are both free to follow these needs. Emotions have to be a way of living, as much as they can interfere with our goals. Both of these partners need to learn to lose control, as well as gain it again, in order to be able to let things flow and change in the way they are supposed to."},"Values":{"Value":25,"Description":"Cancer values their inner peace and wants a stable life with a family they can rely on. Scorpio represents change and values it most of all, even if they are not fully aware of this. It can be difficult for these partners to coordinate their personalities if they are both not flexible enough to understand their differences and the depth each of them has behind these superficial needs. Scorpio can fear emotion to the point of agony and if Cancer recognizes this, they will be able to approach them in the best way possible and discover their true need for security and emotional balance.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Activities":{"Value":95,"Description":"It doesn’t really matter what Cancer and Scorpio will do if they both feel good with each other. They have to share emotions and protect their loved ones – Cancer due to their motherly need to protect people they love, and Scorpio in order to set good boundaries on what they think is right. If they create their own little world, they can be found in any situation together, dealing with things as one being. Scorpio usually likes some dangerous activities and Cancer will have difficulty adjusting to those, but if their emotional core is good, they will have a quiet understanding of each other’s needs, however destructive they might get."},"Summary":{"Value":79,"Description":"A relationship between a Cancer and a Scorpio can go from one extreme to another, and although Cancer partner will try hard to stabilize it, it might be too difficult if Scorpio doesn’t have enough respect for their own emotions. When they find an emotional link, they can go very deep in search of true love, and unite on a level that is unreachable for other zodiac signs. This can make them speak without words, understand each other’s thoughts with only one shared glance and be synchronized in their approach to their future together.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf their emotions aren’t shared on a deepest possible level, or Scorpio partner refuses to deal with them, it could be too hard for Cancer to handle the self-destructive nature of their partner. Their connection needs to be sincere and pure, in order for both of them to be ready to give in to this intense emotional contact."}},"Sagittarius":{"Love":{"Value":40,"Description":"Cancer and Sagittarius will almost never get attracted to each other. If they do, against odds, they could find an interesting shared sexual language that none of them anticipated will be found. The changeable nature of Sagittarius can be somewhat difficult for Cancer to understand because of their opposite need for emotional security. If trust between them is reached in any possible way and true emotions are shared, this characteristic of a Sagittarius partner will become a spice to their sex life, rather than its destructive force.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they have enough emotional security with one another, their sex life could be very fun. Cancer is a sign that exalts Jupiter, and will probably make their partner feel special. On the other hand, Sagittarius will make things light, fun and although the lack of depth could bother Cancer, passion and warmth they bring into their sex life might just be enough to compensate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only way their relationship can succeed is for Cancer to let go of their preconceptions and allows some change and fun enter their strict sex zone. Although they can seem mellow most of the time, they have a tendency to hold on to secure patterns when it comes to things that can make them feel shame or insecurity. In return, Sagittarius will have to lower their expectations on Cancer’s own changeability and sexual creativity, and be satisfied with lovemaking instead of a sexual adventure."},"Trust":{"Value":1,"Description":"Sagittarius is a sign ruled by Jupiter. Deities associated with this planet were considered great lovers, always on the chase for different women, goddesses, nymphs, and whoever seemed attractive enough. More often than not, Sagittarius representatives have the need to show their seductive skills to everyone around them and we could call this a “Zeus’ complex”.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the sign of Cancer loves Jupiter very much, emotions make it impossible for them to understand this flirty need of their partner to win the hearts of everyone around them. Not only will this disturb Cancer’s trust, but it will also affect the trust Sagittarius has in the understanding they will get from their partner. This could be the source of many conflicts and misunderstandings, and could finally lead to the point where their relationship has no purpose or future at all."},"Intellect":{"Value":60,"Description":"Both of these signs strive for knowledge, pure and simple. Their mutual love for it will give them plenty of things to talk about and a deep understanding of each other’s reasoning. Their minds need to find the synthesis of things that surround them and their belief systems can be quite similar. The wonderful thing of their mutual love of Jupiter is exactly in the similarities between their minds and their ways of thinking.\\r\\n\\r\\nCancer can seem a bit slow from Sagittarius’ perspective, as much as Sagittarius can seem superficial or too “philosophical” to Cancer. They can easily overcome these issues if they find a passion they share and usually if these two choose the same profession, they have many things to talk about. They understand each other’s mind and the way their brain works, even when there is a large intellectual difference between them. If they happen to fall in love, communication is something they can always use as means to solve any other problem that appears in the course of their relationship."},"Emotions":{"Value":10,"Description":"This is not a combination of Sun signs that will fall in love very often. As elements of Water and Fire, they don’t really spark each other’s passion and the love between them will hardly ever be the same intensity, at the same time or the same pace. Sagittarius is a mutable Fire sign and they usually fall in love quickly and passionately. If their love is to last, their partner needs to surprise and impress them often, making the relationship exciting and unpredictable.\\r\\n\\r\\nCancer, on the other hand, is a cardinal Water sign, and they will make sharp turns and huge changes, but much less frequently than their partner. Cancers follow their feel of situations and people, and need time to build a relationship in which they feel secure enough to share emotions. When love happens between them, usually Sagittarius feels it first, wants to jump in and out and in and out enough times for Cancer to realize that they cannot build this sense of security to even consider their relationship a true love.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they are to build a love that will last, Sagittarius partner will have to slow down and wait until their partner decides how they feel. In return, Cancer will have to take a leap of faith and jump into a relationship that offers no security, to see if enough love can be found between them so they can stay together."},"Values":{"Value":45,"Description":"Although they value different things and different characteristics in people around them, they have a strong link in the way they value knowledge. Cancer will value Sagittarius’ honesty and their ability to act on emotional impulse, even if they don’t understand the emotion behind the act. Sagittarius will value Cancers dedication to things they love and their incredible ability for compassion."},"Activities":{"Value":5,"Description":"They might study together, but it would probably be a torture for Cancer to watch their partner move from one paragraph to another, only to find what they were really searching for at the end of some old book and then lose interest in the entire subject. Sagittarius will look at their partner as if the entire person just turned into a long, irritating pause. The way these signs use their energy is so different that it is not only difficult to find activities they will do together, but more importantly it is difficult for them to do things in a similar way. This could make the possible impossible and they could be forever separated by a simple difference in their speed."},"Summary":{"Value":27,"Description":"Cancer and Sagittarius are usually signs that aren’t attracted to each other at all. If attraction and love are born between them, they will rarely have a damaging relationship for any one of them, because their signs are ruled by the Moon and beneficent Jupiter. It is safe to assume that they will be good for each other, for as long as their relationship lasts, but it is rare for them to succeed in the long run if they don’t have strong support from positions in their personal horoscopes. As much as Cancer can reach the depth of their partner’s faith, Sagittarius can widen their partner’s horizons and make them much happier in their approach to the world. If they have feelings for each other, it would be a shame not to act on them and miss the opportunity to peacefully grow."}},"Capricorn":{"Love":{"Value":99,"Description":"Cancer and Capricorn are opposing signs and there is a strong attraction between them. When they get together, a passion awakens and they both become perfect lovers for one another. The patience Capricorn has for their partner is something Cancer really needs to relax and start feeling sexual to begin with. Capricorn needs someone who acts on true emotion, but also someone who doesn’t take sex lightly. There are Capricorn representatives who have changed many partners, but they will probably never stay with the one that isn’t family oriented and emotional when it comes to physical relations.\\r\\n\\r\\nIntimacy Cancer can create is exactly compatible to what Capricorn lacks. There is a lack of love, home and warmth in the sign of Capricorn, and Cancer partner can heal this with their highly compassionate approach. This could lead to thawing of Capricorn’s emotional state and uplift the state of their sex life significantly."},"Trust":{"Value":99,"Description":"Although Capricorn might seem trustful, they are probably one of the least trusting signs of the zodiac. Not only is the sign of Pisces in their third house representing the way they think, but they are also often led by panic in their intimate relationships. When a Capricorn representative falls in love, they will understand that their partner needs to see trust and this is what they’ll show. However, they could have trouble believing anything their partner says until some consistency is proven or their stories checked out with other people.\\r\\n\\r\\nLuckily, in Cancer’s world there is often nothing that ugly and secretive to find, for their moral values are as high as the exaltation of Jupiter in their sign. For as long as Cancer feels Capricorn’s devotion, they will not question their actions. This is why Cancer could easily sense their partner’s lack of trust, pretend that they didn’t notice, and find it endearing rather than repulsive."},"Intellect":{"Value":70,"Description":"This is a couple that has the strangest thing in common – genetics. Not literally, of course, but they often share their image of a relationship their distant relatives had, maybe centuries ago. There is information in our emotional body, about each emotion our ancestors have felt and didn’t know how to deal with or how to use. This is where Cancer and Capricorn connect, as signs of the family we come from, and the family we will create.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese partners could feel like they have known each other before they’ve actually met. Their mutual affection will seem familiar and warm, as if they grew up in a same house, even though their circumstances might be completely different. This could make them able to talk about anything, for there is closeness to the relationship of these two signs that is unexplainable to all others.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, if this emotional bonding doesn’t come at first impulse, Capricorn could be very difficult to talk to from Cancer’s perspective. They need to connect on a very deep level, or they will have opposite goals and Capricorn could seem like a career obsessed lunatic with no emotion what so ever, while Cancer could seem like a clingy housewife (no matter if male or female). They should both remember that if they see each other in this negative light, they are probably only hiding from their own, inner opposite side, dismissing the chance to be complete."},"Emotions":{"Value":75,"Description":"Cancer and Capricorn are a love story their ancestors had, waiting to be resolved. Although this could sound like a dream come true and could in fact create very strong emotions in both partners, there is almost always a karmic debt to be repaid before they could say they are truly happy together. These signs represent the axis of Jupiter’s exaltation and fall and it is important to understand that their emotional states are closely linked to their expectations from each other and their relationship.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese two are considered one of the most and one of the least emotional signs of the zodiac. One of them should be family oriented and the other turned to their career. Still, their emotions often run wild as soon as they lay eyes on each other. In time, they will both fight for security and stability of their relationship, and although it might be hard for them to reconcile these primal emotional differences, they will in most cases simply – find a way.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe emotional depth of Capricorn is really hard to reach, but Cancer partner can approach this as their life challenge. When they get tied to each other, it is almost impossible for them not to get married, have children and the entire earthly love package. Still, they could take so much of each other’s energy if they tried to change each other. It is best for them to accept each other’s personalities as inevitable and impossible to change. This could lead to a more sensible future than the one in which they are both simply tired of each other."},"Values":{"Value":70,"Description":"They both value stability and practical sense. As opposing signs, they can seem to have opposing values, but this is not really the case. They both need stability in their lives and will value people who give them the sense of security. This is probably something they will value most in each other, the ability of both not to quit or give up, however hard things might get."},"Activities":{"Value":90,"Description":"Cancer is not very picky when it comes to activity choices their partner has, for as long as they are not imposed on them or too aggressive for their taste. Capricorn is careful and will plan their activities well in advance, so both of them will have time to adjust to the idea or change their minds if they realize that this is not what they want. It will be very easy for them to agree on what they want to do together and find such activities, only if they respect each other’s personalities. Capricorn will not want to go shopping for house decorations, no more than Cancer will want to go three nights without sleep just because of a project at work. If they respect each other’s boundaries, their time spent together should be truly satisfying for both.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Summary":{"Value":84,"Description":"Cancer and Capricorn are usually bound to relive the love story of someone who lived before their time. This deeply seeded need to mend what is broken in our family tree is something we all carry within, but these Sun signs are predestined to handle karmic debts and residue emotions from their families. They will have to deal with problems first if they want to be free of the past, and only after they have repaid what needed to be repaid, will they be able to truly choose one another. In most cases this is a once in a lifetime love for both partners, and they will probably choose each other without a doubt."}},"Aquarius":{"Love":{"Value":1,"Description":"A sexual relationship between Cancer and Aquarius can be stressful for both partners. Although Cancer is considered the most sensitive sign of the zodiac, governed by the Moon, they can be quite rough and distant when they feel the need to set strong boundaries. Aquarius, on the other hand, is known as an innovator, someone to make the change, but in fact, they are a fixed sign, pretty set in their ways and as a paradox – unchangeable.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they engage in sexual activity, Cancer could be so stressed that they will have to set those boundaries and Aquarius will not be able to make the needed change to be gentler to their Cancer partner. There is too much energy in Aquarius that needs to be grounded through their physical activity and this includes sex. Cancer doesn’t really understand this and is convinced that in sexual relations with someone you love only emotions should be shared.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Aquarius finds a way to slow down and not force anything on their partner, and if Cancer allows their rational mind to take over for some of the time they spend together, they might share an exciting sexual experience. Cancer will bring emotions and tenderness to their sex life and Aquarius won’t ever let boring routine take over. If they compromise on experimenting and emotional exchange, they could even start having fun.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Trust":{"Value":35,"Description":"Cancer is usually loyal and honest, except in situations when they are scared of the aggressive reaction of their loved one, or of hurting them badly. With Aquarius, they might feel stressed to share things and this could present a both way issue when it comes to trust. The liberal nature of Aquarius could seem crazy to a Cancer, and their partner’s honesty about their craziness won’t help the inner feeling of mistrust for their possible actions. It is a complicated thing for them, because none of them wants to lie, but still they don’t seem to trust the future they might share."},"Intellect":{"Value":55,"Description":"Cancer and Aquarius are able to join forces in intellectual activity. The mind of a Cancer is sensitive enough to pay attention to details and interpersonal relationships when Aquarius fails to do so. They could make grand ideas come true, especially those that need a lot of people involved on their way to become real.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, they might have trouble talking to one another in the same tone or understanding each other in the first place. Cancer is ruled by the Moon, the fastest heavenly body in the sky, but they are not fast to recognize what hides behind Aquarius’ words. There is difficulty for Aquarius to express their inner state and this is something Cancer has trouble understanding.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best beginning of their relationship is guaranteed if Aquarius sees their Cancer partner as a weird human being that needs to be examined. This will allow them both enough space to get to know each other well, and this could influence all other areas of their relationship. If this happens, Aquarius will approach those strange activities Cancer needs as if they weren’t ordinary at all. After all, not everyone can drink a morning coffee in total silence with their partner and enjoy this silence as much as these partners can."},"Emotions":{"Value":50,"Description":"The unconventional nature of Aquarius interferes with Cancer’s need to stay in a peaceful environment, and this is something they will find hardest to reconcile. That homey, cozy feeling Cancer needs can be deeply disturbed by the rebellious Air sign of Aquarius. They will bring stress and too much information in their life, and speed that cannot be handled by a subtle state of deep empathy Cancer has to live with daily.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe way they show love is very different, but it can be wonderfully focused on their kids and the family they build if they get to this point. There is no sign in the zodiac predestined for a family life such as Cancer. In a relationship with Aquarius, they would take over the most of everyday activities and responsibilities. In return, their children would get a childhood without boundaries and a life of free choices that no other couple can give. This is a consequence of the difference between them and the tolerance they have to build in order to stay together.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they do fall in love, they will not be so quick to end their relationship. Aquarius will approach it as a kind of challenge and understand the stability and love they get from this partner. Cancer will realize that they have never been this free to actually be themselves instead of living in a symbiotic relationship they are easily sucked into. Once they form a strong bond, it will be very hard for both of them to let it go."},"Values":{"Value":10,"Description":"Cancer values knowledge almost as much as Aquarius values information. This is a fine connection between their worlds and if it is nurtured it could be just enough for them not to be set apart by other values they hold on to. Cancer does value stability, intimacy and family, while Aquarius values their freedom, intellect and new technology. There is a difference between their worlds that might seem impossible to overcome, but if they hold on to their love of distances and travel or if they learn together, they could easily get over the fact that their values on other things differ so much.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Activities":{"Value":25,"Description":"While Cancer will want to stay at home, go for a picnic in the park or to a furniture store, Aquarius will look for the highest skyscraper, wish for a new laptop and read anything that falls into their hands. The key activity that could truly connect them is travel. Although Cancer seems homey and unmovable, this is not exactly true. Due to the fact that it is a sign of Jupiter’s exaltation, they will want to travel far. Aquarius will always want to board a plane and it would be perfect if they could parachute to a location where Cancer would safely land in a Boeing 747.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Summary":{"Value":31,"Description":"We could say that Cancer and Aquarius are not your usual happy couple in most cases. Their relationship can be too stressful for Cancer partner and the lack of intimacy will most probably tear them apart. However, the link between them can actually be wonderful when found, and they could open up such interesting new perspectives for one another if this happens. They both want to learn new things and could travel far if a strong base is made at home, so Cancer can remain peaceful.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor this couple to move in a positive direction, Aquarius needs to understand how unusual their partner is, and try to experiment on being homey while having fun. Cancer will have to take over the main set of responsibilities to hold on to the idea of their home as a base from which they can move wherever they want. In the end, Cancer might discover an unbelievable joy of freedom and Aquarius might develop closeness. If these partners can be silent together, sipping on their morning coffee, this is in most cases the first step to success."}},"Pisces":{"Love":{"Value":85,"Description":"Cancer and Pisces are almost always brought together by a romantic love. Their sexual connection is usually primarily emotional. Pisces partner might seem a bit weird and kinky to Cancer, but they should have a feel for each other, strong enough for both of them to enrich their sexual relationship with their own quality.\\r\\n\\r\\nCancer will bring intimacy into their sex life and the meaning behind the act. They will nurture their partner and care about their pleasure, giving them a stable and a safe approach to a healthy sex life. Pisces will bring in change, creativity, inspiration and probably a lot of sensuality due to the fact that this is the sign that exalts Venus. The beauty of this connection is in the emotion they share and the way they cherish each other and respect each other’s sensitivity.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir main problem might arise because Cancer can be somewhat traditional when it comes to sex and Pisces partner doesn’t really understand this. Pisces’ need to connect and feel love is larger than any sort of rule humankind might have made for love. However, in most cases they will be tender enough to inspire their Cancer partner to let go of their rigid attitudes and shame, and give in to the beauty of sexual exchange of emotions.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Trust":{"Value":70,"Description":"It is a good thing that Cancer is usually not aggressive or pushy, or they could easily get dishonesty from Pisces as a response to their tendency to create intimacy and a happy home at any cost. Pisces don’t really understand marriage except as a part of a fairytale ending or because of all that lace, and Cancer will usually want a wedding as a crowning of a loving relationship. This could be recognized as pressure to some point and this could lead to Pisces partner getting scared.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Pisces get scared, they somehow fail to tell the truth even on silly things in their life, because they feel the need to distance themselves from any pressure they might feel. It is a good thing that Cancer understands this and easily separates lies from intimacy. Whatever the situation, they will both probably be patient enough to have just enough trust in one another for their relationship to work out.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Intellect":{"Value":85,"Description":"As changeable as Pisces are, they always have something to talk about. This can be inspiring or irritating to Cancer who would maybe rather deal with “real information”. Usually they communicate just fine, but there are situations in which they could float away on an idea made out of words. Cancer is looking for someone with clarity on the use and the practicality of everything they mention. Pisces is everything but focused on practicality in most everyday situations.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Pisces partner learns to be more silent, relying on their feelings, and starts fighting for what they wish for, they could sweep their Cancer off their feet. Unfortunately, their entire relationship will not last very long if only words are spoken but deeds don’t follow. Cancer’s opposing sign is after all – Capricorn, and they need a partner able to constructively use things, situations and emotions."},"Emotions":{"Value":99,"Description":"Cancer can understand the sensitive nature of their Pisces partner better than anyone else. Everything that seems easygoing and positive might have a hidden negative note in the Pisces world, and Cancer feels rather than listens, which makes them a perfect companion for someone like Pisces. When they sense this deep understanding, Pisces partner will return the favor by absolute tenderness and finally open up to their Cancer partner. When they find this shared point of intimacy where true emotions are shared, this will affect all other segments of their relationship and be a fuel for it to have a fairytale ending."},"Values":{"Value":25,"Description":"This is where the difference in their character really comes to focus. As much as they will both value being loved and cared for, Cancer will value a stable emotional situation and a cozy home to come to, while Pisces will probably value any chance for an emotional rollercoaster more. It is often said that Pisces idealize partners and different things in life, but in fact they get depressed when there is no magic and perfect beauty surrounding them. If their day to day life with a Cancer partner becomes anything similar to a boring routine, they will find a way to run off, find a lover or create any sort of truly exciting circumstances."},"Activities":{"Value":70,"Description":"When they meet and start their relationship, they will probably have a lot of things to do together. A relationship with a Pisces partner is always exciting and inspirational, and Cancer will give it strength, stability and roots. At the beginning, this may seem like a great arrangement, but in time, Pisces might want too much activity for what Cancer partner really needs. This wouldn’t be much of a problem if they would say this to their partner without fear of any one of them getting hurt. If they start bending the truth, Cancer will feel their trust beginning to fade and this could begin a series on problems between them, that could have been easily avoided."},"Summary":{"Value":72,"Description":"As two Water signs, Cancer and Pisces connect through emotions, usually as soon as they lay eyes on each other. This is one of the typical combinations of zodiac signs for love at first sight. Their main challenge is hidden in the changeable nature of the sign of Pisces, not because it is there, but because they might fear to show it. Their biggest problem lies in the fact that they give priority to different types of love in their life. If passion and sensual, sexual love isn’t there, Pisces will rarely be satisfied with the love they get from their family, and Cancer would find a life without a family nest very depressing. A fine balance needs to be made between excitement and stability, and they could be one of the most wonderful couples of the zodiac – Cancer inspired and Pisces with a feel of home."}}},"Leo":{"Aries":{"Love":{"Value":90,"Description":"This is such a warm and passionate connection, in which sparks fly around all the time. They have similar sexual preferences and they definitely take each other seriously, whatever the level of their relationship. As they both have extremely strong personalities, they could fight and make up all the time, but enjoy it in a way some Water signs might find crazy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey have a sexual connection that cannot be interrupted, changed or faded through time, since they are both individual sources of energy, waiting for someone to follow. Still, if one of them has issues with their ego, they could slump into an energy drain system, where they insult each other and destroy each other’s confidence and libido. This is a very rare possibility, but it is always there when two signs that present an extraordinary soil for the Sun come together."},"Trust":{"Value":60,"Description":"There are probably many trust issues in every Aries – Leo couple, but their strong convictions and the need for loyalty mend these problems in most cases. They both think highly of themselves and see how their surroundings react to their partner. Leo is a strong willed, attractive masculine sign, and no matter if male or female, they will have this magnetic aura around them most of the time. This will make Aries strangely jealous and possessive, ready to fight for what belongs to them. Exactly why this problem culminates, for no one can ever possess Leo, the King of the zodiac.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, their mutual understanding for the passionate nature they share and the determination of both partners to solve any problem that stands in their way, might just make them stay together for years, building security and trust every day."},"Intellect":{"Value":90,"Description":"At first, their conversations will probably be unbelievably energized, full of admiration and respect. As they get closer, it can be expected for them to put in an emotional note, but not a very gentle one for their emotions burn like the Fire element they belong to. This is a certain promise of a lot of fights, loud statements and interruptions. Interestingly, as two very passionate people, they usually get over their fights quickly and don’t care much about specific words spoken in the heat of the moment. The moment they cool down, their relationship will easily go back to normal and their sexual life will blossom every time they fight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey are interested in similar things. Aries is interested in Leo, while Leo is interested in everything great about Leo. This is a very nice distribution of interests, since Leo will cherish all the things Aries will say and do for them, and give it all back multiple times greater. This is, of course, the scenario of two healthy individuals in these roles. If one of them has greater psychological issues, their communications will turn to senseless talk about one of them, and their relationship will become a battlefield for the ego where they both constantly need to prove something to each other."},"Emotions":{"Value":99,"Description":"Their emotional natures are very similar. Sun is connected to love, pure and simple, not the nurturing kind but the creative, warm, passionate and playful love. Both of these signs have a strongly positioned Sun, growing on the soil made out of the Fire element. They understand each other’s emotional state perfectly, even when one of them would like to flee from the passionate need of the other to give resistance to something small and seemingly irrelevant.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmotional compatibility of this magnitude is a cure for all other imperfections they might encounter, while evolving in time and spicing their sexual relations with even more warmth and emotion then the beginning of their relationship might have promised.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Values":{"Value":95,"Description":"What these two value most is a person’s ability to stay concise and clear. It is almost as if these were the words that describe them. Anything concise needs strong Mars energy, the ruler of Aries, while Leo brings clarity to all. Their only problem is the need they both have to be the leader and the brave one in the relationship. It is not as if they both can’t be brave, but they have a tendency to compare to one another and search for their role as a lead. This can come between them and manifest as a typical battle of the sexes (in case they are of the opposite sex) or as a fight for dominance of any kind, consuming the quality of their relationship only because of their need to be the one with dominant values in general."},"Activities":{"Value":65,"Description":"They have enough energy to do everything together, but the problem is they don’t actually need the same daily routine. Aries loves to be active, walk, exercise and always feels excited when about to do something for the first time. Leo is a sign of fixed quality, a drama queen of signs, the one that wants to show off and go where they can be seen. Leo’s energy is easily focused to coffee shops and places where they can rest, enjoy and be the center of everyone’s attention. This is a waste of time in the eyes of an Aries, always ready for something different and exciting.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor as long as Aries has the will to initiate their shared activities and compromises for a show off from time to time, they can find things to do together and enjoy them. But if Aries partner gets tired and irritated by Leo’s laziness, there is a big chance they will simply separate their activities all together."},"Summary":{"Value":83,"Description":"The relationship of Aries and Leo is passionate and turbulent, but they don’t seem to mind an occasional fight and a sharp word. When they fall in love deeply, they are almost impossible to separate as they stubbornly hold on to the idea of their future together. Although they are not two of the most romantic believers in love, they are passionate in their beliefs and when they find love, they will fight for it until there is literally nothing left of their relationship.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is meaningless to advise gentle behavior or looking for peace, because the entire world of their relationship is based on the element of Fire they share. It is pointless to look for peace, when the opposite of peace is what attracts them in the first place. For as long as they love each other and stay faithful and true, they will be tied up in a relationship they need to fight for every day. Their main objective is to find a way to enjoy the fight and have fun.\\r\\n\\r\\n"}},"Taurus":{"Love":{"Value":50,"Description":"The sexual relationship between a Taurus and a Leo can be in a way exhausting for both of them. This is mostly due to the fact that they can both be lazy. While Taurus likes to lie down and enjoy being loved, Leo likes to lie down and be served and taken care of. It is in the nature of both signs to spend time in a horizontal position and it might be hard for them to agree on who is to be on top. When motivated, they can both be excellent lovers that put a lot of energy into their sexual activities, but with one another, their sex life will most likely become a battle for personal satisfaction and rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir best possibility of a healthy sex life would be the one where both partners have already built their sexual identity and know how to satisfy themselves. In this case, sensual Taurus would take care of their Leo partner, while passionate Leo would bring excitement into their relationship. In this scenario they would both take care of their own personal needs, aware that they need to commit to their partner’s satisfaction in order for a relationship to work.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general, they are a feminine and a masculine sign, and share a similar need for personal satisfaction. If they don’t end up in a clinch in which they both have expectations and won’t move until they are met, they could have a very rewarding sex life. After all, they are just two different sides of love, joy and life in color."},"Trust":{"Value":60,"Description":"As two fixed signs, they are most likely to stand on their own two feet when it comes to telling the truth. They understand that honesty is the base of any relationship that might last, and if they fall in love, none of them will want to jeopardize their future together. If, however, one of them has a habit to lie or cheat that they have developed in their previous relationships, they will probably continue the same behavior in this one. It is of outmost importance that both of them develop their personalities and moral boundaries independently in order for them to be functional together.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir main problem could be the lack of will on any side to change behavioral patterns that might arise. In case one of them believes that the other one could change, time could consume them through a sense of distrust that builds with disappointment because change doesn’t occur."},"Intellect":{"Value":5,"Description":"They are in luck because they are ruled by Venus and the Sun, both warm and with a tendency to be close to one another, because when it comes to their interests and their intellectual understanding, they could drive each other out of their minds. It is hard to say who will be more annoying to whom. While Taurus holds on to their practical perspective, Leo holds on to their ego, and a conflict with no solution is born. Their fixed natures will make them hold on to their “side” however stupid it might be, with no actual intent of reconciliation. They both need someone with a not so rigid approach if they want to find the middle ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nTaurus will find a mutual language with Leo through their usual, materializing role. Any creative impulse of Leo could be followed by the realization plan thought out by their Taurus partner, if only they shared enough emotions to have patience for each other. Their creative strength is the strength of a Venus in combination with Sun, so we could say with certainty that they would create something in image of universal love."},"Emotions":{"Value":20,"Description":"Taurus is a deeply emotional sign, in case they don’t close up and live in their own little, safe material world. Leo is a passionate sign that represents love as a power of creation and all we feel gravity toward. They are both a personification of love, each one of them in their own way. When they get together, they will rarely feel this love for one another. Maybe we could view this as their mission to give love to the less fortunate zodiacal signs, or maybe their emotional nature has to give more and receive less. Whatever the reason in most cases they simply don’t fall in love with each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a great possibility that they will simply stay in their own worlds, with no prospects of merging even in something close to a friendship. This is not because they don’t like each other or feel some sort of hostility, but because they are like two islands in two different oceans. Each of them has their own nature, their own world with all its beauties, and they need someone closer to this world they hold on to. None of them has the role of a floating island in search for someone to merge with.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf emotions are shared, they could be huge, but there would still be the issue of showing and recognizing them before we imagine a fairytale."},"Values":{"Value":1,"Description":"Taurus and Leo have different views on value itself. While Taurus values financial security and material beauty, Leo values everything shiny, bravery and someone’s inner fire. There is a peace to Taurus that Leo doesn’t want to understand, for it seems like a boring place to visit. Leo values peace, too, but for them it is hidden in a different, much more joyful place or in public, such as peace between entire countries and continents. To Taurus, Leo may seem like someone to strike a pose and have no depth at all, and although depth is not one of their primary values, it is still a very important one. They find nothing interesting in people without essence and neither does Leo, thinking of Taurus and how they don’t open up to share anything deep.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Activities":{"Value":40,"Description":"Shared activities are very easy for both of them to find. Either they will lie down, sleep, eat and cuddle, or they will separate and do things without each other. Taurus is inert and loves to spend time on their couch while the rain outside falls and they hear nothing but the sound of a fireplace. Leo is guided by their nature, and a lion does sleep for 20 hours a day and plays for the rest of it. Even the fiercest of lions wait for their lioness to serve their food. The problem will occur when Taurus sets up a romantic image and Leo falls asleep, but this is still a scenario that could work.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir outside activities can be fun for both of them if they go out to fancy restaurants. This is where Leo can be seen, and act as a gallant person that deserves the best, while Taurus could enjoy really good food. Other than these, they probably won’t have that many activities to share, but if they are not stubborn, they could enjoy everything that is not too demanding and physical together."},"Summary":{"Value":29,"Description":"The relationship of Taurus and Leo could be aggressively challenging if not for their warm natures ruled by Venus and the Sun. Although they are both signs of fixed quality with entirely different natures, if they gather enough patience before they enter their relationship, they have a chance to become your archetypal couple of a girl and a boy. When their masculine and feminine principles are in balance, they can use them to mend their sexual, intellectual and financial circumstances and really enjoy each other."}},"Gemini":{"Love":{"Value":90,"Description":"Everything that Leo would like to show, Gemini would gladly examine. They are a very good fit when it comes to sex, for Gemini gives their relationship ideas and excitement, while Leo brings in energy, creativity and love. Their sex life can be stimulated by their intellect and communication, for they both rely on their conscious Self and their mind. If Leo feels right in intimate relations with their Gemini, as a fixed sign they will give them stability and a chance to last together for a very long time.\\r\\n\\r\\nGemini is childish when it comes to sex, and rarely connects deep emotion with sexuality. Leo could be the right partner to teach them how to make a real intimate connection if they are not preoccupied with themselves. They will both want to experiment, have sexual encounters outdoors and will enjoy being naked. This is a perfect relationship for both partners to overcome shame and any sort of fear regarding intimacy and sexuality."},"Trust":{"Value":45,"Description":"Both Gemini and Leo can be bad listeners when it comes to other people’s needs. One of them is distracted by everything and the other focused only on their own needs. Because of this they could end up in a situation in which their relationship lacks trust and it might take some time for them to notice, because they will not question one another at the beginning. Because of their natures, they could get lost, each of them satisfying their own needs. This will lead to all sorts of situations they don’t want to share with each other, even adultery. It is of outmost importance for them to share and listen to one another from the beginning, in order for both of them to be able to satisfy their partner’s needs instead of letting them slip away."},"Intellect":{"Value":95,"Description":"Gemini and Leo are both rational and focused on their mental activity. Leo does have a deep emotional background, but pays a lot of attention to words and intellectual strength of their partner. This is where Gemini jumps in as a faithful follower, to admire their Leo partner and teach them a thing or two.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they find themselves in an emotional relationship with each other, they will probably talk about everything else but their feelings. Leo might have the need to, in general, but Gemini partner will easily seduce them to go in another direction. They both don’t have much use for sweet talk and if Gemini tries to use the way they have with words, it could work only up to a point where they start sounding fake. There is not much room for overthinking, and they will both probably say the first thing that comes to their mind. This is a great way to build trust between them, if they don’t judge each other in the process and share some emotions along the way.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, there is an issue of Leo’s “perfect” Sun. This position gives so much energy to Leo that they sometimes feel obligated to burn everyone around them by imposing their will. This is a strange need of Leo, since the sign supports Sun greatly, but it is there. They usually have this idea to change the world and make it a better place, and this can drive their Gemini partner crazy in case they don’t have enough room for their own opinions."},"Emotions":{"Value":85,"Description":"The warmth that Leo is prepared to give to their Gemini partner will hardly leave them indifferent, while the charm and childish nature of Gemini is going to spark wonderful emotions in Leo, day after day. Although the mutable quality of Gemini partner doesn’t really go well with the fixed quality of any sign, with Leo it could be a perfect match because of their warm, supporting and respectful nature.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Leo has enough patience to wait for Gemini’s emotions to surface, they could get more than they’ve bargained for. The beauty of their relationship is the consciousness of both of them, leading to verbal display of emotions, once they feel safe with one another. If they both recognize love, this is a wonderful love story full of support, respect and always something new to discuss."},"Values":{"Value":99,"Description":"Most of all they both value intelligence and clarity. As two signs ruled by planets in charge for our mental, rational behavior, they will meet each other’s needs perfectly. Gemini values the independence of their partner and their own freedom, and this is exactly what Leo can give them. On the other hand, Leo always values their partner’s inner child and this is exactly what they will get in their Gemini.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Activities":{"Value":80,"Description":"It is a good thing Gemini wants to go everywhere and do everything, or these two might have a big problem finding activities they want to share. This way, Leo can lift their activities to a “higher level” going to all places that Gemini would suggest, but in a fancy, expensive version. Although Gemini wouldn’t really want to spend that much money, Leo doesn’t mind paying for everything, for as long as they are not feeling used.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, Leo can be very lazy. Gemini is always on the move, and has the need to do at least three different activities every day. When Leo has time to rest, they will probably want to watch TV and move from the left to the right side of the couch all day long. This is something that could build a gap between their worlds, but usually they have enough respect for each other’s needs that they can separate activities and be very happy together. None of them is needy and they don’t want to spend each moment of their lives with their partner, so it will give them both enough freedom – for Gemini to move and for Leo to rest."},"Summary":{"Value":82,"Description":"Gemini and Leo can have so much fun that it could make the rest of the zodiac envious. They both consider their day best spent in laughter, and if they share friends, they could seem like a perfect couple. Their main challenge is the difference in their approach to change and they both need to make room for small adjustments in their behavior if they want their relationship to last. Leo will need to make room for more movement and understand what seems to be “flakiness” of their changeable Gemini partner, while Gemini will have to understand that Leo is in fact keeping them together for however long they are meant to last. Their mutual respect can usually overcome any boundaries, and they should keep having fun and building their relationship on a solid foundation of childish joy."}},"Cancer":{"Love":{"Value":30,"Description":"Cancer and Leo make a very interesting couple due to the fact they are the only signs in the zodiac ruled by the lights in the sky, both of which are not planets – the Sun and the Moon. Although they don’t have much in common, in astrology they represent a husband and a wife and are the king and queen of the zodiac. Unfortunately we know how unsatisfying the sex between a king and a queen can be like.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexual aspect of their relationship depends on the depth of their emotions. As highly emotional signs, each in their own way, they tend to show their love in different ways and this can be a bit hard to reconcile in their sex life. As a Fire sign, Leo is way more openly passionate and this could scare their Cancer away. Cancer is tender and sensitive enough to make their Leo partner feel guilty because of their nature, or Leo could simply have difficulty being tender in the way Cancer needs them to. It is as if a lion and a roe started a sexual relationship and although they don’t want to hurt each other, their primal behavior seems to pull them in that direction.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, because of their rulers, they can get pretty close and share fine emotions in their sexual encounters. Although there won’t be much excitement to them, they could be satisfying enough for both partners if they don’t expect a wild sex life. To find middle ground they really need to be quiet and listen to each other’s needs."},"Trust":{"Value":50,"Description":"It is said that Leo likes to be in the center of everyone’s attention. This is somewhat true and Leo is a born performer, more or less supported to become one. However, their need to show off is something Cancer might find irritating, but not something to lose their trust over. If Cancer feels loved, they have no reason to doubt their partner just because of their nature. Still, the differences between them might lead to a secret search for more compatible partners and this is easily sensed by both partners."},"Intellect":{"Value":10,"Description":"Cancer and Leo, ruled by the Moon and the Sun, represent a subconscious and a conscious mind. Even if they share interests, they will often have a strangely different view on the same thing. They will often just drift apart as the conversation progresses. The Moon does reflect the light of the Sun, but it circles around the Earth. This would be fine if the Sun wasn’t so used to the fact that everyone circles around it. This explains what happens in their relationship once Leo starts talking. Although they shine, Cancer pays much more attention to someone else or to the idea of earthly things they could have together, than to their Leo partner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe base of their communication should be in things that have yet to be discovered. All the mysteries that are there to be solved could be a good starting point because they both need to understand things, each in their own area of dominance. The best possibility they have is in the things that need a light cast on them from two different angles. If they have enough respect for each other, they could learn a lot from each other’s passive and active approach to life."},"Emotions":{"Value":45,"Description":"We can say with certainty that their emotions are a truly beautiful thing. Both signs represent love and although it is not the same kind of love, it is an emotion, pure and simple. Cancer is a Water sign that represent motherly love and all emotions in one’s family. Although this is not always a promise of happiness, the depth of all the love that hides within is magical. On the other hand, Leo is a Fire sign of joy, first loves, fun and sex. Their heart is warm and big, for Leo represents our inner child, and their loyalty is unchangeable when they decide to give it to someone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main problem here is their connection, for Cancer needs to look into somebody’s eyes and feel the love, while Leo wants to shout it out from the rooftops. This could seem untrue to Cancer, as much as Leo could recognize in Cancer something that would rather tie them down than allow them to fly. Both of them have opposing signs ruled traditionally by Saturn and this is exactly why they could recognize true quality in their relationship, as each of them takes their opposing role to learn something. Usually this is not something that can last very long and they will probably both move on to find someone who is more of an image from their seventh house.\\r\\n"},"Values":{"Value":1,"Description":"They simply don’t value the same things. Although this is the point where they separate their ways, it usually takes them long to realize this fact. Cancer values tenderness, emotions, family and a stable life with someone, while Leo values initiative, passion, energy and focus. There is rarely something that they will both value in the same way, or put in the same spot at their priority lists."},"Activities":{"Value":35,"Description":"It helps that Leo would gladly sleep for 20 hours a day. This will make them available at home. They will also gladly be served by breakfast, lunch and dinner, and who better to prepare those than a caring Cancer. However, when they leave the house, they will want to visit different places. Cancer will want to visit their close friends, especially if they have babies, go for a walk by the lake or have a romantic evening at the movies. Whatever they do, they like it with a little intimacy to it. As if to oppose this, Leo will want to spend time at places where they could be seen. Their partner needs to shine to others and hold them by the hand while everyone else claps theirs. This is not often something Cancer will be ready to do, as they don’t really like to be the center of attention. On the other hand, Leo could compromise, but in the end they wouldn’t be happy if their social needs aren’t met."},"Summary":{"Value":29,"Description":"Although the Moon reflects the light from the Sun, the sign of Cancer doesn’t really see Leo as the source of all their joy. Leo is a sign that should spread joy and love with an active approach to each one of their relationships. How is it possible that Cancer is immune? Well probably because the Moon circles around the Earth, not the Sun.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey are special, that’s for sure. Both of them are strong individuals, each on their own plane. Their lack of understanding and emotional touch can be explained through the fact that both of them have a mission to spread love to the less fortunate signs of the zodiac. Not everyone is born with an emotional flow like Cancer and a huge, warm heart like Leo. If they kept all this love to themselves, some unfortunate souls would probably search for them aimlessly, and the world would be a much sadder place."}},"Leo":{"Love":{"Value":50,"Description":"The combination of two Leos can be difficult when it comes to intimacy, but their sex life might be excellent even when they are not intimate at all. Leo’s warm nature and passionate approach to all things in life, including sex, will keep them satisfied together for a long time. However, there is a face behind the act to both of these partners that they might be too proud to show. They usually search for partners that can help them show their core in order to really connect instead of simply having sex as an instinctive act.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main problem that two Leo partners can have are their boundaries and the possible lack of respect they have for each other. While they would both enjoy being with someone who is so confident, they might hold on to the image of confidence for way too long, until all sorts of insecurities surface. It is difficult to develop closeness with all that fire in one place and when you think about it, there is only one Sun in our Solar system and everything revolves around it. Then what do you think, can it be possible to have two of them in one bed, circling around each other?\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Trust":{"Value":70,"Description":"These two have a deep conviction that everything is clear in their lives. After all, they are ruled by the Sun, so how could this not be the case? Although they are usually open with other people, when they get together it is like a constant struggle for supremacy. This could lead to all sorts of „inflated“ stories, those that cannot be repeated and are almost always a product of fiction. Leo is a bad liar, in general, and it would be a shame for these partners to get to the point where they need to prove anything to each other. They have to learn how to be together with absolute focus on the other person. As soon as they turn away and start explaining how great they are, they have lost a chance for trust in advance."},"Intellect":{"Value":65,"Description":"A wonderful thing in this relationship is the ability of both partners to shed a light on one another’s important issues. When they connect on a deeply personal level, they can find a special language of learning and find out so much about their own situations and other relationships. The problem will arise when they start their ego battle to prove to one another who is right and who is wrong. When two Leo partners are in this type of conflict, it is impossible to resolve it because they both hold on to their points that both can be correct. In these situations they should try hard to find the middle ground or they might end up in a serious, lasting fight over an irrelevant thing."},"Emotions":{"Value":90,"Description":"Leo is a Fire sign of fixed quality, and they are pretty hard to change. The Fire of Leo creates warmth, passion and creative energy. This can sometimes fail to be recognized as true emotion, especially by Water signs, and it is a good thing that two Leos understand each other’s emotional depth perfectly. The truth is, Leo is an extremely emotional sign. It relies on Cancer and moves to Virgo, so this is a sign that has an impossible task to connect pure emotion to pure intellect. Their starting point, however, is emotion.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir main challenge in this emotional field is the way to express how they feel and how not to get burnt. As all Fire signs, Leo has a passionate nature that moves fiercely and they can sometimes regret not following their heart. They easily substitute emotion with passion and often burst into flames before they realize how they feel. When there are two of them, their relationship can seem like a chain nuclear reaction that has no emotional foundation. However, there is so much emotion underneath the surface if they choose to stay together, for only a Leo knows how they feel after the outburst has been shown to the world."},"Values":{"Value":99,"Description":"As two representatives of the same sign with such strong characteristics, they value similar things. In general, Leo values bravery, clarity and someone’s inner strength. It is safe to presume that they will value each other because of these primary values. What they will both value the most when they are together is their time for rest and their time for play. As if they were real little lions, these two are capable of truly enjoying their leisure time and each weekend could seem like paradise."},"Activities":{"Value":85,"Description":"Imagine a family of lions in the African savanna, lying around all day, then playing for a while, then licking their paws and calmly purring, well fed and happy. This is exactly what a relationship of two Leos could look like. Although they would spend most of their time in bed and playing, they could actually have so much fun doing so that they don’t need anyone else to keep them company. They are social beings but they don’t care much about spending time with people who don’t know how to enjoy life, and will in most cases enjoy their troop.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only problem they might have is in their need to stay away from things that don’t fit their character. As fixed signs, they will both be turned to a certain routine. Although the base for it will be the same for they are two Leos, they might do it in a different way. For example, if one of them likes to show their admired personality in a club down the street, maybe the other will want to go to a fine restaurant and show good manners instead. It is important for them to stay open for each other’s suggestions because this is the only way their worlds can actually merge."},"Summary":{"Value":78,"Description":"Two Leo partners can do the impossible and this fact could keep them in a perfectly satisfying relationship for a long time. Their main goal is to find true intimacy and understand each other’s inner emotional beings. Leo has a habit to exaggerate and make drama out of small, irrelevant things, but this could be a good thing for their relationship because of their social status and the ability to support each other’s theatrical needs.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they begin a battle for supremacy, it might be a good idea to set the territory that each of them is in charge for. If one of them is the best at an emotional department, the other one can be the best in the sexual one. If they split their rules this way, it will be much easier for both of them to function and think of each other as worthy of the relationship. What might make a loving relationship between them impossible is the lack of respect. If they catch this disease, it might be best for them to part ways and search for different partners."}},"Virgo":{"Love":{"Value":5,"Description":"As two rational signs governed by pure consciousness they could easily agree on the way their sex life is supposed to look like. Still, the shy nature of Virgo and their caution when it comes to choosing a sexual partner might make it difficult for them to find a language they both understand. Leo wants to be with a partner that makes them feel special and even more confident than they already are, and this is hard for Virgo to give. Their relationship can be quite challenging because the passionate nature of Leo doesn’t give much space to Virgo to feel protected and secure about their choices. Their rationality might turn into an intellectual battle for sexual dominance, that is, if they ever reach the point in which they both want to have sex with each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a good thing that Leo is a fixed sign, so they have a conservative note to them that suits Virgo. Still, they will rarely settle for Virgo’s approach to emotions in their sex life, and they will probably both be unable to make an emotional connection that will keep them satisfied. In rare cases when a Virgo partner doesn’t feel ashamed or attacked by a Leo partner, they might share a physically satisfying sexual relationship, but they could still both be too rational together to find any intimacy whatsoever."},"Trust":{"Value":65,"Description":"There is no reason for two conscious individuals not to trust each other in most situations. The problem might arise as Leo partner starts showing off and posing as “the king of the jungle”. Too much attraction that Leo will summon is not something Virgo is comfortable with, and Virgo’s initial problem with trust will blossom if their communication doesn’t make up for the lost confidence.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Intellect":{"Value":50,"Description":"Both Leo and Virgo are ruled by rational, conscious planets, and as such they are usually easy to talk to. However, their personalities are very different due to the difference in the element they belong to. The sign of virgo belongs to Earth, and Leo belongs to Fire. This is why Leo is very passionate and fiery about their convictions, choices and everything that is important to them. On the contrary, Virgo is very practical, down to earth and usually too proud of their intellect to give into passionate, emotional outbursts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese signs together represent the king (Leo) and his followers (Virgo). In the same way, it represents the boss and his employees or a husband and his cleaning lady. The most important thing here is for both of them to remain respectful and tolerant of each other. If Leo shows any disrespect and starts giving orders, Virgo will run off, for this is not the relationship they were looking for. On the other hand, if Virgo partner fails to understand that they chose the king of the jungle, their relationship will not last very long because Leo needs to be acknowledged."},"Emotions":{"Value":1,"Description":"The hardest thing for a Leo-Virgo couple to find is emotional closeness. While Virgo rationalizes everything that happens in life, Leo has a perfectly rational answer to everything. Although Leo can be painfully aware of their need for intimacy, this doesn’t mean they will be able to create it with ease, especially with someone like Virgo.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis can be a great challenge for their relationship, for even when they are strongly attracted to each other and communicate well they don’t seem to awaken each other’s emotions. Although they can both be very intimate with other signs of the zodiac, they will rarely find this with each other. Leo will show his affection through a passionate, warm approach, full of attention and vigor. Virgo will be shy and have a hard time understanding this, while giving love through care that might seem ridiculous to a confident Leo."},"Values":{"Value":35,"Description":"They will both value intelligence and one’s ability to use their mind, and they will value this to the point of indisputable respect. Leo can be smitten by someone’s mind, and this is exactly what Virgo has to give, in case they are not to closed up to show it. If they work together, they might create the exact atmosphere in which anything can be created, but only if they share similar professional interests. Differences between them are still often too big to be overcome by a simple rational mind, and while Leo will value everything that shines, grand and striking things, Virgo will value someone’s ability to be humble and modest."},"Activities":{"Value":55,"Description":"When Leo and Virgo work together, they will have no problem sharing activities however different their natures might seem. Their roles in the zodiac support their cooperation and Virgo has no better boss than a Leo, in case they both don’t have serious ego related problems. With just enough mutual respect, they could do just about anything together, for as long as it can be kept behind closed doors if this is what Virgo wants, and without being exposed to too many people.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeo wants to have the attention of their surroundings if they haven’t been bruised and felt shame too many times, and Virgo doesn’t feel this need. They will rather stay in the shades, behind a leader, someone smart, with a great vision. They like taking care of all the details in order for them both to get to a point of desired success. Since Leo represents our stomach, and Virgo our intestines, they will metabolize different experiences together, guided by Leo’s leadership and passion and followed by Virgo’s practical sense and attention to detail."},"Summary":{"Value":35,"Description":"Leo and Virgo form a constructive relationship that rarely serves their emotional natures. They both tend to be too rational and their mental strength will rarely be a good foundation for a fairytale love they secretly wish for. Both of these signs have opposing signs linked to Neptune. Leo’s opposing sign is Aquarius, the sign of Neptune’s exaltation, while Virgo’s opposing sign is the sign of Pisces, ruled by Neptune. Both of them need someone perfect, someone made just for them, and if they just think for a second that they don’t belong together, their search of perfection will prevail. It is rare for these partners to form a strong emotional or sexual bond, however well they might get along when it comes to work and communication."}},"Libra":{"Love":{"Value":40,"Description":"At first glance Cancer and Libra might seem as if they are really far apart. Both signs have trouble accepting Mars and this leads to a lack of passion and initiative in their sex life. However, the tactful and careful nature of Libra can really soothe Cancer. This is mostly because of the fact that Saturn, the ruler of Cancer’s opposing sign, is exalted in Libra. Although some initiative might be lacking, there is a chance for Cancer and Libra to function very well in their sex life if they spend enough time together.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem with their sexual connection is in their element, more than anything else. Cancer belongs to the element of Water and Libra is an Air sign. Although Libra partner might be extremely patient and nice, there is still a speed to the element of Air that Cancer might have trouble adjusting to.\\r\\n\\r\\nThings they would like to try out will differ greatly, for Cancer needs emotional connection and Libra needs contact, touch and experience before they get too emotional. Libra is not often inspired by the nature of Cancer and won’t normally fall in love with them at first sight. Their sex life can be very good if they already share deep emotions, so it would be best if they started a relationship out of friendship, already knowing each other to some point and sharing some feelings besides possible attraction.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Trust":{"Value":30,"Description":"Cancer can be one of the most trusting zodiac signs, but there is an irritating side to Libra’s nature that they rarely stay immune to. While Cancer wants a quiet family life with no interference from other people, Libra can’t seem to stay away from other people, seeking their affection and approval day after day. At some point their Cancer partner has to ask themselves if this is the kind of partner they want to have children with. On the other hand, Libra finds the whole approach to a romantic relationship Cancer has a bit unrealistic. This can easily lead to a lack of trust in Libra, especially if the Sun is in final degrees of the sign."},"Intellect":{"Value":50,"Description":"As signs ruled by Venus and the Moon, it is safe to presume that their relationship is in a way very important. Although Libra is in charge for the upper, spiritual nature of Venus, it is still a sign of relationships and the Moon will only emphasize the need for closeness and harmony. Their communication will not be too difficult, but there is a chance they won’t share many interests or respect each other enough for it to have true quality.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir main problem could surface if they start making unrealistic plans together. The expectations of Cancer with Capricorn as their opposing sign would be extremely practical and strict. Libra does exalt Saturn, but it is not an Earth sign, and usually they remain in the field of ideas instead of a practical approach to materialization. Cancer doesn’t understand how someone can be so far from reality and this could lead to a strange passive conflict that could endanger their entire relationship. Cancer needs to realize that Libra has its place among the Air signs, in the field of ideas - not necessarily their realization.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is important to remember that Libra has a troubled Sun and usually looks for a partner with more fire and passionate energy than Cancer normally has. However ugly that might sound, they need someone to feed on, and they normally have strong relationships with fire signs which produce enough energy even for their loved ones, or Air signs who don’t really care about it. The sign of Cancer unconsciously calculates and distributes energy to their inner priority list, and they will rarely have an excess big enough to shower Libra in it."},"Emotions":{"Value":15,"Description":"Both Moon and Venus represent emotions, and they are both highly emotional signs. However, their emotional context is very different, for Cancer is looking for a love on Earth and Libra is looking for someone to take to heaven. This is exactly where the spiritual side of Libra’s Venus takes away their true chance to share a life together. It is a Venus that doesn’t need to eat or sleep, for as long as it feels the unique, balanced love. Cancer will understand this idea to some point, but probably look for a more grounded partner when they realize that this is a pattern that isn’t about to change.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs two cardinal signs, they could have a long unsatisfying relationship because they are both waiting for a groundbreaking moment to set them free. In some cases they should be advised to make a change if they are not satisfied, and search for someone who could make them happier."},"Values":{"Value":20,"Description":"As both of them are signs of relationships – family relationships or relationships with partners – they will both value a pleasant and joyful connection between two people. If they find it with each other, they will certainly have trouble letting it go, both of them understanding that it is not that easy to find. However, their entire system of values differs greatly beyond the point of relationships, and while Cancer will value tenderness and care, Libra will value responsibility and platonic love. That doesn\'t sound promising, does it?"},"Activities":{"Value":10,"Description":"Cancer and Libra could do many things together, but it is questionable if they will want to. Cancer is a sign that exalts Jupiter and although they can be perfectly happy with a grumpy partner, they would appreciate them not to have a need to impose their grumpiness on them. There is a secret desire to every Cancer to travel the world, while having the safe base to come home to, but Libra could destruct their beliefs and lead them to doubt they simply don’t want to deal with. With Cancer’s mild and mellow temperament, Libra will probably feel even more inadequate and grumpy, for they need someone to be their opposition and defy them in order to have respect and sexual charge.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Summary":{"Value":28,"Description":"Probably the biggest restriction in the relationship between Cancer and Libra is in things they want from their partner. Cancer wants someone responsible, to take them by the hand if needed and complement their emotional nature with practicality. Libra wants someone who is full of life, energized, strong and full of initiative to follow their ideas. They can really disappoint each other if any expectations are set wrongly at the beginning of their relationship. The best way for them to build a love that is to last, is for both partners to hold on to their independence whatever happens. If they focus on love and worry about earthly things each on their own, Cancer could “compromise” on heavenly love, as much as Libra would like to have a family."}},"Scorpio":{"Love":{"Value":5,"Description":"This is a complicated relationship between two strong personalities with an incredible sex drive. Leo is a passionate lover, warm, always in search for action and they can be quite casual when it comes to their sexual encounters. Scorpio is sex itself, and the depth of emotion that goes with it in its purest form. When they get together, they could have real trouble finding middle ground between their personalities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese partners can seem as if they’ve crashed into each other with no plan or purpose. If they are attracted to each other, this could drive them mad, for none of them will be able to realize their desires in a wanted way. If they end up having sexual relations, they could have misunderstandings on everything, from their verbal communication to their physical needs. They simply don’t operate in the same ways and while Leo wants to be respected, Scorpio understands that all respect dies in the act of sex.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is extremely difficult for a Leo and a Scorpio to reach intimacy, because they have a different view on emotions. What Leo sees as love, Scorpio finds superficial and irritating, and what Scorpio sees as love, Leo finds depressing and irritating. They both need to give up control entirely if they want to find sexual satisfaction with each other.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Trust":{"Value":65,"Description":"The positive side to this relationship when it comes to trust is in the fixed quality of both signs. This is not such a good thing when it comes to their ability to adapt and be flexible for each other, but it is a perfect thing for mutual trust. If they set the clear foundation in the beginning of their relationship, Leo transparent as they are and Scorpio direct and honest, they might trust each other without exception for a very long time. That is if they both want to be open for this kind of relationship in the first place.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Intellect":{"Value":30,"Description":"It is a good thing that these two signs can be so well behaved. Although this is not always the case, Leo wants to show the right image to the world, and Scorpio understands karma better than many other signs. This is why they will probably have enough respect for each other to communicate in a civilized manner. They are both obsessive in a way. Leo will never give up on chasing their passion, with enough energy to spark everyone around them, and Scorpio will hold on to things they care about, and obsessively fight for their goals. If they share the same passion or interests, they will have something to talk about, obsessively.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe depth that is typical for Scorpio is something that Leo tries hard to reach in their search for Unity. Their conversations can be very tense and irritating for both, but along the way they might realize that they give each other exactly what they both need."},"Emotions":{"Value":1,"Description":"This is probably the most challenging relationship in the entire zodiac when it comes to emotions that these partners have for each other. In some cases, they can be identified with hate, but the important thing to remember here is that hate is also love, in its “negative” form, and both of these partners will think that any emotion is better than no emotion. Their a bit torturous relationship can hold them together for a long time, even though they might be unhappy and aware that they could be happier with someone else. In a way, Scorpio likes to be tied through negative emotions, for love sometimes has to hurt, and Leo sticks with their decisions because they rarely accept that they might have been wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis relationship can become a very difficult circle of suffering for both partners, especially if any one of them doesn’t have their independent life, friends and finances. When they do, they might find a fine balance, for as long as they both have freedom to think that there might be better options for them with other people. If they don’t find any, they could realize that they are perfect for each other as self-sufficient individuals, through a healthy approach."},"Values":{"Value":35,"Description":"Both of these partners will value honesty and clarity. Although they understand clarity in different directions and depth, the main characteristics in people they wish to date are very similar. Often, they won’t even recognize their similarity out of an emotionally unstable or obsessively stable position, completely different from a passionate, creative one. They have to deal with the value of creation against the value of destruction and this is not easily reconciled. The bridge between them is found in unconditional honesty."},"Activities":{"Value":40,"Description":"It is very interesting how a Leo and a Scorpio might organize their time together. While they are in most cases interested in different things, Scorpio is ruled by Mars, a planet that Leo understands well and cooperates well with. They will both have the energy to follow each other’s desires and they could actually have a lot of fun. Still, they usually stumble upon a problem when it comes to their understanding of certain circumstances and people around them. There is rarely a compromise between the positive, constructive approach of Leo and the often negative, sensitive approach of Scorpio, especially when none of them is exactly true. It would be best for them to remain true to themselves, and understand that there is a middle ground between their opinions and feelings, however strange it might seem."},"Summary":{"Value":29,"Description":"When Leo and Scorpio start dating, they might not know exactly what they are to expect. This is in no way an easy relationship, and both partners can be stubborn and stiff in their opinions, life choices and ways they handle reality. If they want to remain in a loving relationship, they need to understand each other’s way of expressing emotions and respect each other’s needs however different they might be from those they are used to. When they find a way to love each other without conditioning, they might realize that they are in search for the same thing – Unity."}},"Sagittarius":{"Love":{"Value":99,"Description":"As two fire signs, one of them fixed and one of them mutable, Leo and Sagittarius share a warm love for each other. When they start dating, their sexual relationship might come as a surprise for both of them, for they will feel liberated to be exactly who they are with each other. The best thing they could do is use the trine between their Suns and build-up each other’s self-esteem, especially if they have been in demanding or disrespectful relationships prior to theirs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best thing about their sex life is the passion they share. Leo is there to bring inner fire for the act of sex, and Sagittarius to fire up the expansion, the places, positions and horizons. They will both enjoy each other in a fiery way and respect each other’s bodies, minds and entire personalities. If they stumble upon one another and love is born, their sex life could represent a perfect connection for both of them.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Trust":{"Value":80,"Description":"Since they spark each other’s sense of security and confidence, they will rarely show jealousy or misunderstand each other’s actions. Leo does like to be the center of attention and feel attractive and desirable, but this is something a Sagittarius partner can provide in abundance. There is usually no reason for them to lose trust over time, except when their emotions start to fade. Sagittarius is a mutable sign, and as such, they can fall in and out of love quickly and frequently. In case Leo starts feeling left out and unloved, the suspicion will rise, and what better way to respond to suspicion than by becoming suspicious yourself, Sagittarius might think. Although they both might be unaware of the root of their issues when trust is lost, it is usually a simple lack of love."},"Intellect":{"Value":85,"Description":"Leo and Sagittarius are both very focused on their mental activity. Leo because they are ruled by the Sun and this gives them a certain rational awareness and Sagittarius because they always aim higher from the Earth, philosophical and wide opinionated. This is something that will help them communicate about almost anything, even though their interests might differ and their backgrounds as well. Leo has the ability to help Sagittarius when they get lost, and this could happen often if their plans are grand. Sagittarius will give Leo vision and the ability to understand the future of their current creative efforts. Together, they make an important part of the process of creation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs two highly aware individuals with a strong sense of Selves and their personalities, they could build up an incredible understanding. They can both be loud, communicate a lot, and this could make their relationship truly remarkable, deepening their intimacy through openness they share to get into each other’s worlds. Since they both have a strong personality, they will not feel threatened by each other’s character and each other’s strength of opinions and convictions. The only thing they might lack is the sensibility to outer influences and their fiery relationship could make them a bit too rough on each other, and on themselves. Still, the power of creativity and their active approach to life should keep them interested in one another and very well connected for a long time."},"Emotions":{"Value":80,"Description":"As two Fire signs, Leo and Sagittarius tend to be very passionate and open in showing how they feel. They will want to show their love, share their love and act on their impulses as much as they can. This can sometimes be too much, for no passive, fragile emotions or energy will be respected. Some balance would come in handy, especially if they often fight. Conflicts between them could be quite aggressive, not because they are that aggressive themselves, but because two fires build an even larger fire. It is almost like they might explode if they both go too far.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they fall in love, this seems like the warmest, cuddly love on planet Earth. In most cases, this will be enough to overcome any difficulties in their way, but sometimes these partners both tend to forget their actual sensitivity. They have to understand when the time has come to slow down, stay at home, talk about nothing at all and just be quiet. If they don’t, they will probably turn to someone who can give them this kind of peace from time to time."},"Values":{"Value":65,"Description":"They will most certainly value each other’s strength of character and incredible personalities, the ability to warm each other up in every possible way and the passion they carry within, each for their own purposes. Still, it is not easy to explain to a Leo why it is so good to run away from the world, travel in Greenland alone, and eat bugs somewhere in Asia, except if one wants to show their courage. On the other hand, Sagittarius doesn’t really understand why they would go to fancy places and confront all the people that it is easier to run from. This is not a consequence of a lack of courage, but the lack of meaning they feel when they need to spend their time on tiresome people. So although they value the same thing – courage, they see it through different eyes."},"Activities":{"Value":40,"Description":"We would think that Leo likes to travel just as much as Sagittarius. They have the energy and the need to search for knowledge and widen their horizons, but they don’t exactly like to move that much. This is due to their fixed nature, and although they would like to visit any possible part of the world, they wouldn’t do it at the same pace as Sagittarius, nor would they choose the same destinations. Sagittarius, on the other hand, doesn’t really understand why Leo wants to perform in front of so many people when there are starving children in Africa. These are simplified examples, but they serve us pretty well to understand how well they might work together, travel together, perform together, but only if they are open enough to ad purpose and strength to their approaches.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Summary":{"Value":75,"Description":"Leo and Sagittarius are a very good fiery combination of signs, and when two people with these Sun signs come together, they inevitably fall in love. This love is warm, passionate and inspiring, and they will have a chance to create, perform and have fun together for as long as they feel this way. However, Sagittarius partner might lose interest in Leo because they tend to get pushed away by their static, fixed nature. The only way they might get to keep their passion and emotions going, is if they manage to listen to their softer emotions and remain tender and sensitive for one another.\\r\\n\\r\\n"}},"Capricorn":{"Love":{"Value":5,"Description":"Leo and Capricorn have one thing in common and it is their awareness of their Selves. It will be a rare occasion when Leo is attracted to a Capricorn, but the other way around attraction seems more probable. However, they won’t often get to the sexual part of their relationship, for even though they both might enjoy the chase, they will not see their future together.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeo is a warm, passionate sign, and Capricorn likes to be coolheaded and practical. This doesn’t mean that Leo isn’t at all practical, or that Capricorn isn’t passionate, but they won’t see each other as similar in any way. The rulers of these signs represent one of the archetypal conflicts of the zodiac, and tell the story of the fallen ego. This need could easily pull them both in a direction which will endanger their self-esteems and affect the image they have on their beauty and attractiveness. This is usually ignited by Leo’s freedom of sexual expression that Capricorn fears, leading to the insecurity in both partners because they are not able to fit into each other’s set of expectations.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir sex life can easily become boring for both partners, and what they often don’t realize is how similar they actually are. The only way for them to have a healthy sex life is to share warmth and always bring new experiences, spicing things up. If they find themselves in a rut, they might stay there for a very long time, leading to the loss of libido and confidence, up to a loss of any sexual desire."},"Trust":{"Value":40,"Description":"Capricorn knows that Neptune falls in Leo. This is exactly why they also know what hides behind the act in their Leo partner. The depth Capricorn is prepared to go to makes Leo partner question their own motives and their whole personality. Lies seem to be impossible in this relationship, for each lied told, comes right back. As much as Capricorn sees behind the shine of Leo, Leo shines a light on Capricorn’s darkness. Nothing stays hidden for long and as soon as one of them tries to stay secretive, mistrust is awaken. However, in many situations they tend to trust each other because it gets so obvious that there is no reason not to."},"Intellect":{"Value":60,"Description":"Their priorities differ greatly, and they both have a strong set of personal priorities in their lives. This is something that will not be easily reconciled and these partners could spend too much time trying to prove to one another why each of them has a point on what comes first. The problem is in the lack of understanding that each one of them has their own mission and their own role. It is futile to insist on someone’s priorities changed when they should be different to begin with.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they respect each other enough to accept some pretty big differences, their communication might be very satisfying and fulfilling for both of them. Leo will help Capricorn find a more positive and creative view on every situation and Capricorn will give Leo the depth and the serious intentions they need. When they combine their abilities to organize, any plan made could be perfect."},"Emotions":{"Value":1,"Description":"A relationship between a Leo and a Capricorn partner can be truly emotionally challenging, not because they don’t love each other, but because they do. Warm emotions of Leo are easily cooled down and buried, and without the ability to express love, Leo can become pretty depressed. In return, the time Capricorn needs to build the emotional story they need, will be roughly interrupted by their fiery Leo partner. This could hurt them, or lead them to the opinion that Leo is not the right person for them, however attractive, smart, capable or beautiful they might be.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem with this couple is in the way they build up emotions, and their best chances are in time and patience, things that Leo rarely possesses, and Capricorn rules. There is no other way to reach the heart of a Capricorn partner and discover that they can be warm too. If there has been too much pain in their prior emotional relationships, both partners could be almost too stubborn to get to the point where they might actually fall in love."},"Values":{"Value":50,"Description":"Leo and Capricorn both value well organized people, presentations and plans. Leo is not much of a plan maker, they would rather go with the flow and look only a couple of days in advance, and they respect Capricorn’s ability to focus on the final destination and weigh every step of the way. Still, the sensitive, calm, emotional center that Capricorn values is never found in a Leo and unless they are truly inspired by their Leo partner, they could take away their worth just because of preferences. Leo values direct, open hearted people with big smiles, and as soon as they judge Capricorn for not smiling all the time, they might as well end the relationship."},"Activities":{"Value":5,"Description":"Activities these partners might share depend greatly on their priorities, once again. If Leo wants to settle down, they might find it interesting to spend time in a usual, Capricorn way. In return, if Capricorn needs some additional energy and vigor, they will gladly follow Leo in their chosen activities. The most important thing in their relationship is good timing. If it doesn’t exist, they will simply resist, stubbornly, doing anything the other person wants to do."},"Summary":{"Value":27,"Description":"If they meet in the right moment, Leo and Capricorn might get along very well. The main problem in their relationship is the set of priorities they might not share, and the passion or determination that both of them have. It is not an easy job, reconciling Saturn with the Sun, but it brings great benefits when it is done. The structure Leo could get and the creativity they might build on together could lift them to exactly what they desired, however their relationship might end. They differ as much as the Earth and the Fire, but when they share a common goal, they are unstoppable.\\r\\n\\r\\n"}},"Aquarius":{"Love":{"Value":99,"Description":"The attraction is always great in relationships of opposing signs, and it is probably the greatest in a relationship of Leo and Aquarius. Leo is the king of the entire zodiac, and Aquarius seems to be there to bring down the king and fight for independence. Imagine the attraction and the passion between two such strong individuals, lying on the axis of Sun’s rule and detriment.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir sex life is a struggle, a fight and an incredible experience for both. Liberating and yet warm and passionate, sensual but still interesting. When they find true emotion, Aquarius might actually end up respecting the king. The beauty of their sex life is in things they can learn about their bodies, their confidence and the way they look at the act of sex. Through the struggle of insecurities and forced liberation, these are two partners to form a strong connection by a simple act of gravitation that the Sun has over Uranus."},"Trust":{"Value":75,"Description":"Everything seems clear in a relationship between Leo and Aquarius when we look at it from a distance. However, these signs represent the axis of Neptune’s exaltation and fall, and they will almost always have the challenge of trust and the search of truth in their relationship. Although they could find incredible understanding and freedom for both partners, usually when they separate they realize how little they have actually known about each other and how little trust they shared in the first place."},"Intellect":{"Value":90,"Description":"Both Leo and Aquarius are heroes in their own way. While Aquarius is reaching for heroism, looking for ways to set free from repression, Leo was born a hero and sometimes doesn’t even know it. If they end up fighting for the same cause, they could turn down entire governments and use their incredible force to change anything in the world. To get there, these two would have to stop the battle they have with each other, because energy can be scattered on their unnecessary fight for dominance in a relationship.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeo is a sign ruled by the Sun and has the ability to give clarity to any situation. No matter how confused they might be or how lost they may sound, if you take a closer look to the time spent with them, you will see that they’ve brought clarity in your life. Aquarius, on the other hand, understands the necessity of change and they seem to carry around a spark to ignite and excite any possible situation that they find worthy. This can be irritating to many, especially Leo, but in fact it is a necessity of liberation we all carry within."},"Emotions":{"Value":99,"Description":"Leo is exactly what Aquarius needs to find love. It is a strange thing how they find each other, on the grounds of their former relationships, to liberate and shine as if they have been searching for one another for many lifetimes. While Leo is the Sun, Aquarius is a lightning and it usually comes out on a rainy day. This is exactly what they need to understand – there is a time for both of them to shine and they don’t endanger each other’s chance to do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Leo falls in love, the entire world can feel it. The warmth pours out from the center of their being and one has to be blind or senseless not to pick up the signals. Aquarius can hide their emotions much better and often has trouble expressing and acknowledging how they feel. It is a good thing that Leo’s warm emotional nature will melt even the coldest of hearts and there will be no safer place for Aquarius to share their love than in these fiery arms. The only thing that can endanger their emotional relationship is their everlasting ego battle and they should both pay attention not to be too proud to let go to love."},"Values":{"Value":80,"Description":"The deepest value they share is the value of individuality. Someone with a strong character, who knows exactly what she or he wants, cannot stay unnoticed by Leo or Aquarius. Although they will not agree on many other things, this is the one that could connect them strongly, because they are both such strong individuals in the eyes of each other.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Activities":{"Value":90,"Description":"While Leo shines, Aquarius likes everything shiny. The need Leo has to show off might be a bit disturbed by Aquarius’ tendency to show what others don’t want to see. From a different perspective, this should help Leo feel more free and confident, although it might not seem so in the beginning. They will both like to show off, each in their own way, and it is only important for them to set the territory for both partners to be expressed. Just like the Sun and the lightning don’t go together, Aquarius should take over on a rainy day, in a depressive crowd or in places where they both feel as if they would drown. This is where Leo needs to give in and let their partner rule the sky if they are planning to keep the relationship going. There will be enough regular, shiny chances and days with no clouds for Leo to rule.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Summary":{"Value":89,"Description":"Signs of Leo and Aquarius combined represent the ultimate creativity, famous scientific discoveries, the first man in an airplane and the first man on the Moon. Imagine what these partners could do together if they let each other lead the way when the territory of their rule is in front of them. They both need to learn to let go of the image they have about themselves and about each other, or they won’t get very far stuck in their unnecessary ego battle. Warm and cold, hearted and smart, nuclear gravitation and vacuum in space, it cannot be easy to mend their differences or form a stable, loving relationship. The best thing they could do is find a cause they will support together. This would give them a focus on the outer world and allow them to deepen the inner emotional world of their relationship while fighting outside of it."}},"Pisces":{"Love":{"Value":1,"Description":"It is incredible how two signs that represent love, can be so wrong for each other. Leo will seem like a brute, caring selfishly about their own needs, incapable of forming an intimate relationship with anyone, let alone Pisces. Although this is not true, it might be the obvious reality to Pisces if they end up in a relationship with Leo Partner. In return, Leo will think of Pisces as weak and unrealistic, completely separated from their own desires and the strength of their body or emotions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe truth is, they can both be incredible lovers but they will rarely discover this together. Their roles and characters seem to be too different for them to find a way to coexist in a satisfying sexual relationship. The main problem of their relationship is in the fact that the sign of Leo is a sign of the fall of Pisces’ ruler, Neptune. In a practical sense, this means that Leo will burst the bubble of Pisces and endanger their sensitivity, idealism and go against their beliefs. This will ruin the romance between them and make it impossible for them to find any magic while they are together.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeo’s openness and directness will make Pisces feel ashamed and rushed, and their sex life could be delayed indefinitely until Pisces partner feels secure enough to get naked. Because of differences in their approach to sex, Leo will in most cases seem like an insensitive brute, unless Pisces start understanding their emotional depth even though it is so different from theirs. The best way for these partners to find a language that can sustain their sex life is by building emotional trust first and worrying about sexual satisfaction later."},"Trust":{"Value":1,"Description":"Neptune is a planet of all deceit and mistrust in the world, making things around us seem foggy, unclear and fake. Pisces is the sign ruled by Neptune, and Leo brings it to its fall. This is a difficult combination of signs to reach a point of mutual trust. They will both seem dishonest to one another, not because they lie, but because their characters seem unreal. Leo will think of Pisces as if they were always on drugs, and Pisces will feel sorry for Leo and their lack of faith."},"Intellect":{"Value":35,"Description":"Ideals Pisces have could be shattered by the approach of Leo if they get too close to one another. They could share many interests due to the creative power of both signs. Pisces will easily give inspiration to Leo, but the problem is in the way Leo might use it. The best way for them to create a safe surrounding for both partners, is to stick to the subject they are individually interested in.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeo is a warm sign, very passionate about their doings and their desires. Pisces will rarely show the same initiative to realize any of their dreams and this is their greatest difference. Since Leo always shines a light on our virtues and shortcomings, they will not miss a chance to show their Pisces partner how unrealistic they are. This could help Pisces build a more realistic approach, but it could also affect their confidence and hurt them through a difficult perception of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Emotions":{"Value":15,"Description":"Both of these individuals are extremely emotional, each in their own way. The Fire element Leo belongs to, makes them passionate and gives them the need to fight for their loved one and their emotions. Pisces is a Water sign, and much more passive, showing their passion through the flow of emotion. They will rarely fight for anything, convinced that perfection doesn’t need fighting for and that real treasures are spontaneous and free of conflict.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe middle point for these partners is in their realization that not everything needs to be won, as much as not everything should be uninfluenced. Although true emotions are supposed to develop without difficulty, sometimes life is testing us to see if we really care. Still, this is not something that happens all the time, and sometimes things need to be let go because they don’t belong to us, and we don’t belong to them."},"Values":{"Value":20,"Description":"It is interesting how much both of these partners will value clarity and honesty. Pisces partner understands the necessity of lies, but still lives for clarity of the mind and the realization of their true inner Self. A great link between their worlds of values is in Leo’s heroic nature that seems to have roots in a fairytale of Pisces. As much as they will both value their individual set of beliefs, they will be able to find middle ground in the grandiose character of Leo and the idealizing nature of Pisces.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Activities":{"Value":10,"Description":"As a fixed and a mutable sign, they will have trouble synchronizing their need for changes and new activities. Although Leo is a Fire sign, always ready to start something new, they will like to stick to their routine and show themselves in all the usual places every day. Pisces want to be invisible and they will change the scenery often in order for people not to recognize them. Although they could share some interests and have activities they would like to share, they will rarely stick to the same place and same actions together for very long."},"Summary":{"Value":14,"Description":"Leo and Pisces seem to be put on this Earth to spread entirely different kinds of love. The problem isn’t in their element or their quality, as much as it is in their connection through the fall of Neptune, the ruler of Pisces. If they get attracted to each other, they will be subjected to the risk of great damage to their beliefs, their inner faith and usually succumb to mutual disrespect because of a simple lack of understanding. The beauty of their relationship could be developed through the fairytale approach of Pisces, if they build the heroic image of their Leo partner to the point in which other differences between them fade."}}},"Virgo":{"Aries":{"Love":{"Value":10,"Description":"It is hard to say if Aries and Virgo would present the clumsiest or simply the worst couple when it comes to sex. Aries may look at Virgo and think of Virgin Mary, her chastity and what we would call a total absence of sex. There is nothing more asexual for Aries than a person without an obvious sexual identity. To express their sexuality or feel sexual at all, Virgo needs patience, verbal stimulation and a lot of foreplay. This is where Aries comes in as a brute with no manners or tact what so ever, to sweep them of their feet with a passionate nature that looks superficial and completely unattractive. The real question is – how did these two get attracted to each other in the first place?\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir intimate life can be good only in case Aries accepts to wait and communicate about things they don’t find important at all, or if Virgo was so disappointed in their previous relationships that they turned into a sexual predator, open for an interesting turn in their intimate life."},"Trust":{"Value":70,"Description":"In case they overcome their sexual difficulties and stay together against odds, their problems with trust shouldn’t be significant. Aries usually has the need to be honorable and straightforward, except in rare cases when they cannot contain their sexual appetites. In most relationships, Virgo is obviously faithful and hates being lied to. This is why they have a need to be honest and ask for honesty in return."},"Intellect":{"Value":30,"Description":"These two can be so annoying to each other that they might annoy everyone around them. When you think of a partner who brings out the best in you, Aries and Virgo are the worst possible match. The downside of an Aries partner is their impulsive nature, readiness to fight and the tendency to lose their mind over something that might not be that big of a deal. The possible downside of Virgo is hysteria and continuous, never ending talks, when they are not understood.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a known fact that Virgo likes things clean. Well Aries is like an animal in their cage, especially if they are crazy enough to decide to live together. This could lead to endless, pointless fights, because Aries will never change their nature, or their priorities, while Virgo will seem like a crazy person screaming, with gloves on and a huge bottle of antiseptic liquid in their hand. The good thing is that before they get to this stage of the relationship, they will probably find each other extremely repellent and break up instead.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo good that could come out of this strange bond is their intellectual cooperation, in case they share the same interests or work. They will awake each other’s intelligence, challenge each other’s mind and probably think of entirely different, but constructive solutions for problems that might occur."},"Emotions":{"Value":20,"Description":"When it comes to emotions, we could say that their emotional compatibility is better than their sexual one. Still, as Virgo is primarily an intellectual sign, a sign where Venus falls and the lack of emotion is evident, and Aries usually mixes up love and sexual attraction, it is hard to achieve a quality emotional connection between them. Their best chance for love would be the silent observation by Virgo partner for some time before they get together, because this would give a rational advantage in knowing the person they are starting a relationship with. It would also be good for Aries to think before acting, not a usual thing they would do.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they knew each other as friends, going through their emotional experiences with other people prior to them becoming a couple, they could know each other well enough to make their relationship work. When Aries goes from friendship into a sexual relationship, they tend to be much more considerate and gentle. Without sexual involvement Aries is more tolerant and a better listener, so friendship will provide more substance to their romantic relationship."},"Values":{"Value":50,"Description":"They both value hard work and ambition, as well as clear and sharply deduced information. This is what makes them great as colleagues, but this is not exactly the most important set of values a happy couple would share. Their relationship could be based on their joint business though. This would give more meaning to their conversations and everyday life.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther things they value don’t coincide that much. Aries is all for bravery and an attitude while Virgo thinks of these as stupid, unless they are a part of tradition or have historic significance. Virgo values intelligence while Aries thinks success has nothing to do with it and sees it as a possible reason for loneliness and sorrow. Still, these would rather be the reasons to tease each other and have a nice laugh, than they would have the capacity to tear their relationship apart."},"Activities":{"Value":70,"Description":"It is a good thing that Virgo is a sign of mutable quality and always concerned about their health, or they would never think about following Aries to their activities. Still, there is always a chance that Virgo will use their health to get out of these activities and spend some time alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a couple that could go for a run because it’s healthy, spend time in the nature because it’s healthy, think about their bodies together because it’s healthy, have regular intimate relations, once a week, because it’s healthy and to sum up, anything that’s healthy would be easy to incorporate in their relationship. Also, it is a very good thing that Aries doesn’t care much about “empty time”, such as watching television or opening solitaire, because Virgo would rather read or clean than subject to these activities for the “permanent damage of the brain”.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem in this area of their relationship is connected to activities that don’t leave much sense of dignity or make careful Virgo feel scared, or the activities too boring for an Aries personality."},"Summary":{"Value":42,"Description":"It’s a good thing that the relationship between an Aries and a Virgo is never boring. Although in most cases they are not really meant to last, it can still be a fun experience if none of them takes their potential for a shared future too seriously. In case they take the best out of their relationship, giving it enough freedom and unpredictability, Virgo would incorporate some of Aries’ energy, while Aries would allow Virgo to teach them how to organize their thoughts and communicate calmly. This way they might come to the point where their relationship could actually last, and the outcome depends on their ability to relax and have fun together."}},"Taurus":{"Love":{"Value":85,"Description":"The sexual relationship between a Taurus and a Virgo can be quite touching. Virgo partner is usually ashamed to show their sexuality, or their body for that matter. This is where Taurus gets in the picture as a hero setting their Virgo free. The gift of Taurus is their ability to relax their sexual partner by giving them enough attention and obsessing about their satisfaction. To their Virgo partner this seems almost unreal, for they would expect something rough and scary when it comes to sex. This is an ideal combination of partners for first sexual experiences, because Virgo can enter the world of sexuality in the gentlest way possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem here can arise because of the nature of Virgo and their need to go into detail and analyze everything. Not only can they damage the spontaneity of their sex life, but they could also affect their Taurus’ self-esteem by finding little flaws on their body and in their actions.\\r\\n\\r\\nVirgo is a sign of virginity and is a place where Venus, representing all satisfaction, falls. The fear of being hurt is sometimes too big to handle and with Virgo’s view of Venus they rarely understand the side of sexuality that is in relation to satisfaction and tenderness. Taurus is a sign ruled by Venus and their understanding of sex is quite different. They seem to have a mission to explain what tenderness is to those around them, and find someone like Virgo a perfect student for their teachings. They will gladly explain to their partner what the beautiful side of sex is, only if Virgo is ready to listen."},"Trust":{"Value":75,"Description":"Virgo doesn’t trust anyone with ease. This is due to the fact that Pisces are their opposing sign, and they see every partner in their life as a glimpse of the unknown. It is not easy to open up to such an enormous field of possibility when you feel so small.\\r\\n\\r\\nTaurus is much more relaxed and gives so much importance to the beauty of sex, so if Virgo doesn’t feel adequate with their Taurus partner, it will not be easy for them to believe in their honesty or faithfulness. This mistrust will really hurt their Taurus partner, for they can’t understand what they did to deserve it and they will probably blame it on Virgo’s changeable nature, thinking that they are not that honest, either."},"Intellect":{"Value":90,"Description":"Intellectual strength of Virgo is exactly what Taurus needs to build a better understanding of the world. It is often said that Taurus can be really stubborn and difficult to talk to, but it is almost certain that a Virgo will use their mutable quality to find different approaches in order to explain their point of view. As two Earth signs, they can both stick to their convictions and be too rigid not to accept another’s point of view, but in most cases, the intellect of Virgo and the tenderness of Taurus can help them find a language they both understand whatever the situation.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Emotions":{"Value":85,"Description":"The patience Taurus can have when they fall in love is what makes them such a good fit for Virgo. Since Virgo will not recognize their feelings right away, they will need time to set a strong emotional foundation. Because of the lack of trust and disappointment Virgo is almost always ready for, Taurus needs to stay put and never let them down in order to build the trust and let their feelings for each other evolve.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they are not both too stiff and too afraid to get hurt, they can build a strong and deep emotional relationship with mutual respect intact. It is really important not to stay at a safe distance for too long, because they could easily build a relationship with no emotion and stay in it, unsatisfied, for years, even though they might have had potential to fall madly in love."},"Values":{"Value":50,"Description":"They don’t exactly value the same things, but they will be okay for as long as the feminine side of Taurus isn’t disrespected. With Taurus’ ruler in fall at the sign of Virgo, their Earth to Earth understanding is a bit damaged. Since Venus represents all value, Virgo could show what Taurus would recognize as a lack of understanding in general. However, they will both value the nature of Earth element, stable, secure and slow, and this should give them enough time to mend the differences and find middle ground."},"Activities":{"Value":55,"Description":"Taurus can truly seem lazy to their Virgo partner, especially when they are on a satisfaction spree and don’t leave the house except if they are on their way to a nice restaurant. The intimacy of their nature scares Virgo to the point of agony and they will quickly need a change of scenery not to feel like they are standing in one place for eternity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Taurus approaches their usual activities in a way to respect Virgo’s occasional obsession with their health, they could think of a number of things to do together, and complement each other very well. The preparation of healthy snacks would be just one of possible suggestions to satisfy the needs they both have.\\r\\n\\r\\nVirgo is a sign ruled by Mercury, and although it belongs to the element of Earth, they need to move. Taurus can be really static and it is important that they make a decision to follow their partner or they really won’t have much of a future together. It is a good thing that Taurus is usually guided by inertia, so when they get used to movement, this will become a permanent state for both of them. Although you wouldn’t connect these signs to travelling, when together, they could feel and follow the urge to travel the world."},"Summary":{"Value":73,"Description":"In general, Taurus is there to teach Virgo about love, tenderness and sexuality. Virgo needs to be flexible enough to value their Taurus and give them the intellectual view on things they might idealize. Their relationship could be a match made in heaven, only if they are not too scared of being hurt and too distrustful. If they do give in to each other and fall madly in love, they could be the combination of a clear heart, represented by Taurus, and a clear mind, represented by Virgo. What more would they need than each other?"}},"Gemini":{"Love":{"Value":5,"Description":"Gemini and Virgo are both ruled by Mercury, not a very sexual planet at first glance. However, this affects them in different ways, for Gemini is a masculine sign, always ready to explore, while Virgo is a feminine sign, shy and sensitive. Their sexual relationship is hardly promising, but they both have the need to communicate. If they find a language they both understand, they might agree on the way their sexual life is to progress. However, there is a big chance that endless discussions will not lead to their mutual understanding, leaving them distant and not interested to share any sexual experiences.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they fall in love, they will use enough tenderness and respect to make their sex life work, but it will still rarely be satisfying for both partners. They are both curious, but not in the same way, and have an extrovert vs. introvert conflict. While Gemini would often like to be free to get naked and run around the streets, Virgo would prefer if everyone kept their bodily fluids to themselves. To top it all, they both need verbal stimulation, but the words each of them would like to hear often aren’t what the other person knows how to say."},"Trust":{"Value":1,"Description":"What a combination! With Virgo’s trust issues and Gemini’s trickster nature, both of them are about to go crazy. The good thing is that they are not prone to jealousy, or they would probably kill each other after a couple of weeks. Gemini is not someone Virgo can trust. When Virgo starts doubting and analyzing everything, Gemini will simply fly away, in the best case scenario. If they have a touch through maleficent planets, such as Mars, this will not end there, but in endless fights and conflicts on trust and fidelity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe key here is for Gemini to get back to planet Earth and respect the sensitive nature of their partner. They can build their security and be free to be who they are at the same time. Also, Virgo will have to open up, or they will never find a way to stay together."},"Intellect":{"Value":80,"Description":"They are ruled by the same planet, master of communication, Mercury. They may have their differences, but we wouldn’t say their communication is bad. Even if they have a fight, they will still be good at talking. Their view on intellect could be a bit different though. Gemini’s superficial nature could seem extremely stupid to their Virgo partner. This will set Gemini off to be even more irritating on purpose, because they are everything but stupid. In return, Gemini will see Virgo’s obsession with details and think of them as crazy. Virgo will probably not fight this, but sit in their room and cry, alone, in the dark.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey need to find a way to recognize each other’s “flaws” as good qualities and they will get there if each of them lets their partner help. When these minds come together, there is no problem to stay unsolved, for together, they are Mercury in all its glory. These signs have a mission to unite and transform heavenly ideas into real life, and lift human knowledge step by step, towards divinity. This is a relationship of the Air side of Mercury and its Earth side, grounded and well thought of. It shouldn’t be forgotten that the sign of Virgo exalts Mercury so Virgo can exalt their Gemini partner, if only they wanted to land."},"Emotions":{"Value":55,"Description":"Gemini is considered not that emotional. Virgo brings Venus to its fall and rationalizes everything. Still, there is an interesting emotional side to both of them. Gemini is located between Taurus and Cancer, two strong, feminine, motherly signs. This means that the sign of Gemini is formed out of Taurus and is a base for Cancer. How can it lack emotion than? Virgo has a problem with Venus, that is true, but does this make Virgo unemotional?\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir biggest problems are speed and fear. Gemini simply doesn’t stay in one place for long enough to build an emotional bond or recognize how they feel, while Virgo tries hard to dismiss Venus and with it love and all earthly pleasures because they don’t think they deserve any of it. Both signs have a small, fast planet in common, and if they touch each other’s hearts, they will understand their partner’s occasional need to run off, or run away."},"Values":{"Value":70,"Description":"They are both fans of intelligence, resourcefulness and practicality. However, their approach to basic intelligence is different and they won’t always recognize it in the same way. In fact their relationship can show us exactly how relative intelligence is. Their meeting point is actually in their emotional intelligence, not our typical one. However, they do value rationality, someone’s ability to reason and one’s practical use of their hands and their brain."},"Activities":{"Value":30,"Description":"It is a good thing they both like to read, so they can visit a library every once in a while. Virgo will probably stay there for a bit longer, not even noticing their Gemini partner got lost and accidentally found an emergency exit that they had to use to see how the big handle on huge red door works. The lack of self-value Virgo suffers from constantly will make them question every location and activity their Gemini partner would want to take them to. Even if they try to hide it, their hesitation will be felt and Gemini will rather go alone than push someone to come along.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth of these signs are mutable and as such have a tendency to change locations, interests, relationships. This can allow them to stay on the move together, if only Virgo was open enough for exciting new experiences and Gemini finds a way to not get lost."},"Summary":{"Value":40,"Description":"The relationship of Gemini and Virgo can change as the wind, while both partners get lost and found on a daily basis. Their mutual love for Mercury is what binds them and what tears them apart, because they both tend to overthink things instead of following their hearts. Both of them are mostly in their minds, each one in their own way, and need to respect each other to the point where no one’s intelligence is judged on a superficial level. If they do fall in love, they will become a unification of Air and Earth Mercury – heaven on Earth."}},"Cancer":{"Love":{"Value":95,"Description":"When Cancer and Virgo get together, there is potential for a great, everlasting love. They have a possibility to become an inspirational contact of heart and mind, if only they give in to the opportunity to enter each other’s worlds.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir sexual relationship seems to be a lecture on emotion. The sign of Virgo brings Venus to its fall and suffers from a general lack of emotion. It is a rational sign with a lot to analyze, that rarely gives in to the first impulse or their fragile emotional state. They are to learn on how to feel safe enough to let their guard down and shut their mind off in order to feel and enjoy sex. Cancer doesn’t really understand how someone could have trouble getting in touch with their emotions and can have unrealistic expectations because of this. They will learn to understand their partner better and make a stronger sexual bond, realizing how different people can be."},"Trust":{"Value":99,"Description":"If someone can help Virgo build their trust, it is their Cancer partner. Although Cancer is a cardinal sign, they are stable by nature, especially when it comes to emotional decisions they have made. If they have chosen Virgo to be their loving partner, they will have no reason to lie or cheat. This behavior would only endanger their vision of a shared life and a loving family they want with the partner they chose. This is also a reason why Cancer won’t have an initial problem with trusting Virgo. Their convictions are stronger than their doubt."},"Intellect":{"Value":80,"Description":"They are ruled by the same planet, master of communication, Mercury.

If Cancer starts showing their emotions openly and with no restriction, Virgo might get scared and start analyzing every little thing to determine if any emotion is really there. There is probably no greater turn off for a Cancer than someone who rationalizes their own emotion. As if the fight to keep them afloat among the human race isn’t enough, now they have to deal with a neurotic partner who dismisses them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe emotional side to Virgo is a deeply feminine side, usually ashamed to show her face, especially if Virgo partner is male. It becomes almost impossible for them to feel something if they are in any way pressured or feel mistrust with their partner. Virgo would rather be alone, with a right book, than with the wrong person, and it takes a lot of patience and rationality from their partner if they want to understand and wait for the ice to melt. If Cancer manages to do this, there is no reason for both of them not to resolve any other emotional issue that needs resolving, mutual or individual, while together."},"Values":{"Value":50,"Description":"If they form a truly functional and beautiful relationship, they will value each other. To Virgo, their Cancer partner will seem much more down to earth and rational than they are, and to Cancer, their Virgo partner will have a recognized soft spot in their heart. Other things won’t matter much when they find each other, because there is no compromise they both wouldn’t make to keep this love going. However, their different values might represent an obstacle to them getting to this point in a relationship. As a deeply emotional and the most intelligent sign in the zodiac, one of them values family, love and understanding, and the other intellect, attention to detail and their health. It is not like they don’t have a meeting point, but it will not be easily found if they both stubbornly keep to their habits and opinions."},"Activities":{"Value":90,"Description":"Although Virgo is a mutable sign and they can be pretty hard to follow, they do belong to the element of Earth and will be capable to wait for their Cancer partner to decide whether they will want to join them or not. This is very often a relationship of two people who can manage without each other, so they will not be bound by shared activities as much as some other signs might be. If one of them wants to do something, unless truly insecure, they won’t take it as a personal insult if their partner doesn’t want to do the same thing. This is where their rational compatibility will really come in handy, as they make arrangements for their time together.\\r\\n\\r\\nUsually there will be just enough movement and romance for both of them to feel special, and this is certainly not the main concern in their relationship. After all, they would both gladly go to a movie and eat some popcorn, so there is always something they can do together, even if their needs are very different.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Summary":{"Value":77,"Description":"Cancer and Virgo can have a wonderful connection and are usually brought together by sexual understanding. The main problem of their relationship is in the possible conflict between emotional Cancer and reasonable Virgo. If they manage to overcome this, accepting each other’s shortcomings and learning to incorporate some rationality or some emotion into their lives, they could end up in an inspiring relationship that will last for a very long time. In a way, they complement each other as much as the heart complements the mind. If they share a spark of love, it would be a shame to miss the opportunity for happiness just because of someone’s irrational expectations or someone’s closed heart.\\r\\n\\r\\n"}},"Leo":{"Love":{"Value":5,"Description":"As two rational signs governed by pure consciousness they could easily agree on the way their sex life is supposed to look like. Still, the shy nature of Virgo and their caution when it comes to choosing a sexual partner might make it difficult for them to find a language they both understand. Leo wants to be with a partner that makes them feel special and even more confident than they already are, and this is hard for Virgo to give. Their relationship can be quite challenging because the passionate nature of Leo doesn’t give much space to Virgo to feel protected and secure about their choices. Their rationality might turn into an intellectual battle for sexual dominance, that is, if they ever reach the point in which they both want to have sex with each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a good thing that Leo is a fixed sign, so they have a conservative note to them that suits Virgo. Still, they will rarely settle for Virgo’s approach to emotions in their sex life, and they will probably both be unable to make an emotional connection that will keep them satisfied. In rare cases when a Virgo partner doesn’t feel ashamed or attacked by a Leo partner, they might share a physically satisfying sexual relationship, but they could still both be too rational together to find any intimacy whatsoever."},"Trust":{"Value":65,"Description":"There is no reason for two conscious individuals not to trust each other in most situations. The problem might arise as Leo partner starts showing off and posing as “the king of the jungle”. Too much attraction that Leo will summon is not something Virgo is comfortable with, and Virgo’s initial problem with trust will blossom if their communication doesn’t make up for the lost confidence.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Intellect":{"Value":50,"Description":"Both Leo and Virgo are ruled by rational, conscious planets, and as such they are usually easy to talk to. However, their personalities are very different due to the difference in the element they belong to. The sign of virgo belongs to Earth, and Leo belongs to Fire. This is why Leo is very passionate and fiery about their convictions, choices and everything that is important to them. On the contrary, Virgo is very practical, down to earth and usually too proud of their intellect to give into passionate, emotional outbursts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese signs together represent the king (Leo) and his followers (Virgo). In the same way, it represents the boss and his employees or a husband and his cleaning lady. The most important thing here is for both of them to remain respectful and tolerant of each other. If Leo shows any disrespect and starts giving orders, Virgo will run off, for this is not the relationship they were looking for. On the other hand, if Virgo partner fails to understand that they chose the king of the jungle, their relationship will not last very long because Leo needs to be acknowledged."},"Emotions":{"Value":1,"Description":"The hardest thing for a Leo-Virgo couple to find is emotional closeness. While Virgo rationalizes everything that happens in life, Leo has a perfectly rational answer to everything. Although Leo can be painfully aware of their need for intimacy, this doesn’t mean they will be able to create it with ease, especially with someone like Virgo.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis can be a great challenge for their relationship, for even when they are strongly attracted to each other and communicate well they don’t seem to awaken each other’s emotions. Although they can both be very intimate with other signs of the zodiac, they will rarely find this with each other. Leo will show his affection through a passionate, warm approach, full of attention and vigor. Virgo will be shy and have a hard time understanding this, while giving love through care that might seem ridiculous to a confident Leo."},"Values":{"Value":35,"Description":"They will both value intelligence and one’s ability to use their mind, and they will value this to the point of indisputable respect. Leo can be smitten by someone’s mind, and this is exactly what Virgo has to give, in case they are not to closed up to show it. If they work together, they might create the exact atmosphere in which anything can be created, but only if they share similar professional interests. Differences between them are still often too big to be overcome by a simple rational mind, and while Leo will value everything that shines, grand and striking things, Virgo will value someone’s ability to be humble and modest."},"Activities":{"Value":55,"Description":"When Leo and Virgo work together, they will have no problem sharing activities however different their natures might seem. Their roles in the zodiac support their cooperation and Virgo has no better boss than a Leo, in case they both don’t have serious ego related problems. With just enough mutual respect, they could do just about anything together, for as long as it can be kept behind closed doors if this is what Virgo wants, and without being exposed to too many people.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeo wants to have the attention of their surroundings if they haven’t been bruised and felt shame too many times, and Virgo doesn’t feel this need. They will rather stay in the shades, behind a leader, someone smart, with a great vision. They like taking care of all the details in order for them both to get to a point of desired success. Since Leo represents our stomach, and Virgo our intestines, they will metabolize different experiences together, guided by Leo’s leadership and passion and followed by Virgo’s practical sense and attention to detail."},"Summary":{"Value":35,"Description":"Leo and Virgo form a constructive relationship that rarely serves their emotional natures. They both tend to be too rational and their mental strength will rarely be a good foundation for a fairytale love they secretly wish for. Both of these signs have opposing signs linked to Neptune. Leo’s opposing sign is Aquarius, the sign of Neptune’s exaltation, while Virgo’s opposing sign is the sign of Pisces, ruled by Neptune. Both of them need someone perfect, someone made just for them, and if they just think for a second that they don’t belong together, their search of perfection will prevail. It is rare for these partners to form a strong emotional or sexual bond, however well they might get along when it comes to work and communication."}},"Virgo":{"Love":{"Value":30,"Description":"It would be funny to say that two Virgos don’t understand each other when it comes to sex, but true attraction and the emotion behind the act, seem to be missing. It is a good thing they can communicate and make their sex life much better through the art of speech, but unless they are madly in love to begin with, they could both simply think of their sexual relations as inadequate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main problem with the sign of Virgo is their search for faults, and this can be a real deal breaker when it comes to sex. When two Virgo partners enter a sexual relationship, this need for criticism multiplies, and what’s worse, they seem to motivate each other to grow it and make it even stronger. None of these partners realizes that this takes away their emotional or sexual satisfaction, and makes them feel tense. In most cases they just realize that they don’t feel relaxed with one another, often not even knowing why.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe good thing in a sexual relationship of two Virgos is their respect for each other’s sense of shame and the pace they want their relationship to move in. Their mutable quality will help them make the necessary changes to make things work, and even if their sex life isn’t satisfying in the beginning, they might be able to adapt until they reach the point of satisfaction. Creativity is the key here. And their training to live in the moment, without noticing every single detail that doesn’t work between them."},"Trust":{"Value":70,"Description":"When these partners come together, they stand face to face to their own issues with trust awaken by the sign of Pisces in their seventh house. Since they share the same set of convictions on trust that needs to be built, usually quite traditional, they often end up resolving these issues together. Still, they both need to remember that as soon as one partner questions the other, the favor will be returned, and the circle of mistrust can suddenly escalate to the point where they both start feeling the need to hide."},"Intellect":{"Value":99,"Description":"If there is something Virgo is capable for, it is communication. Similar to the sign of Gemini, Virgo can be quite eloquent and smart, both of them ruled by Mercury, the master of communication. Since the sign of Virgo is related to the written word, much more than to the spoken one, these partners will probably want to text each other all the time, for as long as their chats don’t become dull and boring.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey are both highly intellectual, but also very quick to dismiss someone else’s intellectual strengths if they differ from their own. When it comes to evaluating someone’s words, Virgo can be extremely critical and focused on details that most other signs wouldn’t see as important at all. The beauty of the relationship of two Virgos is in their shared understanding for the importance of details. Unfortunately, this can be the thing that will distance them from the bigger picture and make them preoccupied with things that really aren’t important."},"Emotions":{"Value":25,"Description":"If there is something Virgo is capable for, it is communication.

If there was a sign to show us how different similar people can be, it is the sign of Virgo. These partners have their own opinions and thoughts on everything. It will be very hard for them to find a partner, even if it is another Virgo, to coincide fully with their system of value. In most general issues of life, they will agree, and they will both value intelligence, capability and one’s focus on details. Still, they might have a hard time adapting to each other’s emotional or professional values, especially if their choices of profession are too far off."},"Activities":{"Value":85,"Description":"Two Virgos can really do anything together. When it comes to everyday things and the routine they both care about, they will find excitement and joy in most of their activities. Their choices make them feel proud and happy they have found someone who shares their appreciation for certain “smart” activities, but the challenge in their choices is hidden in the fact that none of them likes Venus very much. This fact could lead them to a point of apathy, where none of them lives their life in color, to the fullest, threatening their creative energy. They need to remain in love, creative and romantic, or it will be very hard for them to truly enjoy the time they spend with one another."},"Summary":{"Value":65,"Description":"When Virgo decides to be with another Virgo, we can assume that their relationship is a product of one of two possible things, the first one being the need for stability and their rational decision to be with one another, and the second one being the unexplainable force of love at first sight. Whatever the case, both partners are quite rational and belong to the sign of mutable quality, so their emotions can change very fast. Because of their shared tendency for sacrifice, the lack of faith they have in themselves, and the tendency to rationalize everything with value, they might easily end up in a relationship where none of the partners is actually in love, or satisfied. It is imperative for them to act according to their hearts if they want their love to last.\\r\\n\\r\\n"}},"Libra":{"Love":{"Value":1,"Description":"The sexual relationship between a Virgo and a Libra just doesn’t seem like a good choice. Virgo is an Earth sign ruled by Mercury, relying highly on their intellect, while bringing Venus to its fall. Libra is an Air sign ruled by Venus, and couldn’t be more distant from Virgo’s shy nature or practicality when it comes to sex. They will probably be driven crazy by each other, one of them trying obsessively to keep things clean and looking as if they were scared of any emotional contact, and the other strict in their search for spiritual love and a partner they can really talk to.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost often, they are not even attracted to each other, and when they do begin a sexual relationship they have to face the challenge of speed. Virgo will want to move slowly, and even though their mutable quality makes them pretty adaptable, it is often not enough to reach Libra’s speed of Air. They might find a middle though, when Libra relies on their exaltation of Saturn and slows down, while Virgo adapts and changes more quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they find their perfect timing, both partners might still end up unsatisfied. Virgo was expecting a fairytale connection seeing the image Libra shows and they will find so many faults in their partner’s approach. Libra’s self-esteem doesn’t really tolerate that much criticism and they will probably see Virgo as boring, stiff and unaware of any emotional connection they wanted to make. For this sexual relationship to work, they need to coordinate the emotions they give and receive. Only then will they be able to satisfy each other."},"Trust":{"Value":25,"Description":"It is a good thing Libra exalts Saturn and their need to be fair is, in many cases, more than obvious. If this wasn’t the case, Virgo would dismiss each word they say to begin with. There is a lot of tension between them, for they don’t understand each other’s primal natures. This is not so much an issue of trust, but it comes down to it when the dust settles. There is no way to explain to shy, introvert Virgo, why Libra has to have everything out in the open. It is even less clear why so much attention must be brought to their relationship, or why does their Libra partner flirt with everyone that looks decent. On the other hand, Libra doesn’t really trust the moodiness of Virgo and think of their partner’s fear of expression as if there is something they want to hide."},"Intellect":{"Value":60,"Description":"They will understand each other perfectly for as long as they speak of taking responsibility and serious matters in life, such as professional choices and their income. This can keep them in a pretty good place for quite some time, especially if they share the same professional interests or have a goal to support each other in learning or advancements of any kind. Even if they touch the subject of emotional contact, they will still see eye to eye for a while. Both of them value rational choices and smart moves.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut then, true emotions will surface in one of these partners, and they might realize that communication between them is no longer possible. As soon as one of them has to deal with a personal issue, the other one seems to freeze, losing all ability for compassion of closeness. The problem here lies in the fact that their relationship is based on their mental connection and this interferes with actually loving one another, and providing a kind word at an important time.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Emotions":{"Value":1,"Description":"Their emotional contact leans on the point of their communication for they are in a strange coexistence. There is no couple more prone to separate emotionally than these two, and this can lead to so much dissatisfaction in both of them, with both partners unable to end the relationship they don’t feel good in.\\r\\n\\r\\nVirgo is a sign where Venus falls and this is the ruler of Libra and a planet that, shoulder to shoulder with the Moon, represents our emotions. The value and stability of emotions that needs to be found by Libra, seems to lose all meaning when rational Virgo comes along. Libra will instantly fit into the expectations of their partner, trying hard to be that voice of reason, more rational than they actually are. As time goes by, the emotions they have kicked away will cumulate, returning in a sudden wave that cannot be stopped. There is no way to control the emotional nature of Libra, and this is something they will both learn in this relationship."},"Values":{"Value":30,"Description":"This is a couple that will value all the same things until they discover that this simply isn’t true. It is a strange deceit that comes between them, as if they were both able to practice something entirely out of their reach. The guilt they will subconsciously feel for dismissing each other’s (and their own) emotions will take out the satisfaction between them and leave them in the state of wonder – how can two people that value so many similar things, value something entirely different by the end of the relationship?"},"Activities":{"Value":65,"Description":"Virgo is a mutable sign and they will adapt to any desire their partner has with ease. Libra is tactful and thoughtful enough for Virgo not to feel bad about their choices. There is rarely anything extreme about their contact and they will mostly enjoy the usual, relationship activities with one another. Even their pace can be synchronized well enough, as Virgo is much faster than the rest of the Earth signs, while Libra’s indecisiveness makes them quite slow. They need to pay special attention when Virgo helps with decision making, taking even more of Libra’s already bruised ego. This can lead to serious problems, not only in deciding on future activities, but in their mutual respect."},"Summary":{"Value":30,"Description":"Virgo and Libra can form a very satisfying intellectual bond, for as long as they respect each other’s feelings. In general, this relationship can sometimes work, and these partners can synchronize their pace, choose appropriate activities and build a satisfying sex life with enough patience and care. They could have a deep problem with emotional understanding though, and the thing they will find most difficult to reconcile is their fragile egos. Virgo, willing to please, will easily take over the responsibilities and decisions that Libra needs to take on. This will lead to a feeling of inferiority in Libra and the loss of respect toward their Virgo partner. If this issue is left unresolved, their relationship might end because of disrespect they were both unaware of in the beginning.\\r\\n\\r\\n"}},"Scorpio":{"Love":{"Value":65,"Description":"If there is something Scorpio would like to fight for, it is the chastity of Virgo. This is a very interesting couple in the domain of sexual activity – one of them hiding their sexuality, and the other acting as sex itself. Even though Scorpio can be too rough of Virgo, making them feel uncomfortable and even violated in a way, in most relationships between representatives of these two signs, there is enough rationality to the approach of Virgo to make this contact possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat we often fail to understand is the fact that Scorpio is a Water sign and as such – deeply emotional. Virgo looks for someone emotional to share a life with, and if they share this emotion of Scorpio through their sexual relations, they will both find sex between them extremely satisfying. The best time for Virgo and Scorpio to create enough safety and emotion in their sexual encounters, is in the situation where they are each other’s first truly emotional experience. If they surprise each other with the power of emotions beneath the surface, that both of them seem to carry around, they will have a hard time ever separating from one another.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe biggest problem of these partners is in their relation to Venus, and this can lead to loveless acts of sex that both partners are not truly satisfied with. They need to show love and be tender enough, enjoying themselves enough, or they might have to move on to someone they love more."},"Trust":{"Value":90,"Description":"Trust is a very challenging issue for both of these signs and this is something they can finally talk about with each other. There is a strong understanding here, for one of them fears betrayal more than anything, while the other hates it and gets vindictive as soon as any sign of dishonesty is in sight. The best thing about their connection is in their ability to understand each other in silence, not ever wanting to let each other down."},"Intellect":{"Value":99,"Description":"Virgo is a talkative sign, ruled by Mercury the planet of communication, but they hold on to a much more quiet and intellectual side of Mercury than we might anticipate. Scorpio represents a deep silence of the flow of a river, and they will both have a strong urge to jump into the depths of silence together. Their intellectual contact is stimulating, often strongly influencing their sex life and their truly deep emotions. It is almost as if they wouldn’t be able to form a relationship without this ability for non-verbal communication that makes them perfect for each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth of these signs are prepared to go all the way - Virgo in their intellectual depth and Scorpio in everything in life. This will inspire both of them to search for all sorts of answers together, analyzing each other’s psyche and determining the source of their problems with the world, or with each other. Through carefully chosen words, they can help each other heal or regenerate from difficult or even devastating experiences. It is a good thing for both of these signs to have each other in the time of need."},"Emotions":{"Value":75,"Description":"If someone can reach the emotions hidden behind the extremely rational approach of Virgo, it is Scorpio. We could say that this ability hides in both of them and the dig up goes both ways. The problem here is in the fact that they remind each other of their imperfections. Scorpio is a sign in which the Moon falls and at the same time the sign of Venus’ detriment. All emotions get lost here, as if Scorpio is a black hole that cannot get enough. Virgo partner is already sensitive and when in love, does everything they can to satisfy their Scorpio partner. This can feel like investing into a black hole with no gratitude whatsoever.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, there is no other sign that can sense the needs of Scorpio better than Virgo, and no other sign that can dig up the emotions in Virgo better than Scorpio. An emotional relationship between them can turn out to be truly dark and difficult, but also incredibly strong and intimate. The only thing that can bore their emotions to death is the criticism they are both prone to."},"Values":{"Value":70,"Description":"Both of these partners will value depth, intellectual most of all. There is nothing in the world that is as exciting as conversations that are so intense and so challenging for their minds. Most of the time they will agree on things they value most, although they might stumble upon a huge problem when they get to the point of throwing out the trash. Even though Scorpio doesn’t normally accumulate things, and loves throwing them away, those they hold on to can be quite disgusting to a Virgo. Just imagine as their first child is born and Scorpio wants to frame that dried out residue of an umbilical cord. Do you think Virgo would want to wake up to this in their apartment every morning?"},"Activities":{"Value":55,"Description":"For the same reason their values might differ, their daily routine might differ too. Virgo will clean, that’s a fact, simply because a clean house creates a clear mind, and Scorpio won’t have much trouble fitting in, unless their personal belongings are questioned. However, when they choose places they want to visit, or clubs they want to go to, their choices will differ greatly. It is not hard for them to compromise to keep the relationship going, but it can be quite dark and demanding for both partners. If they don’t start willingly hanging out in some tidy cemeteries, they might run out of options that would actually keep them both interested and happy."},"Summary":{"Value":76,"Description":"That changeable nature of Virgo will be settled down by the fixed quality of their Scorpio partner, who will keep their relationship exciting for a very long time. In general, there is a problem that these partners share when it comes to Venus, and their relationship is often a reflection of these troubles. This can lead to all sorts of emotional blackmail, their tendency to control each other’s lives, and if not this, than constant criticism that makes them both feel guilty or simply sad. The best thing they can do is decide that they will value each other and be thankful for each other in this relationship. If they develop a strong sense of gratitude, their relationship might be extremely deep, exciting and truly appreciated by both partners.\\r\\n\\r\\n"}},"Sagittarius":{"Love":{"Value":30,"Description":"Just like all mutable sign combinations, these partners could have a lot of fun. Even though Virgo can be quite demanding and critical, especially from the point of view of Sagittarius, their sex life can be satisfying for both. The good thing about their connection lies in a fact that these signs are ruled by planets that also rule their opposing signs. This means that they will feel attraction and a need to begin a sexual relationship in the first place.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main problem here is in the difference in their elements. Virgo is an Earth sign, and as such, doesn’t often take too many risks. Sagittarius is a Fire sign, and they will passionately force things until they reach their goal. This doesn’t work well in their sexual contact, for Virgo might feel pushed into things they don’t want to do, and Sagittarius might be turned off by the practical and static nature of Virgo. The most important thing these partners should remember is that they both need room to be who they are. With two such giving people, sex life comes down to who will satisfy whom best, as soon as they deal with unrealistic expectations.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Trust":{"Value":1,"Description":"If you dig for the biggest problem in the relationship between a Virgo and a Sagittarius partner, you will realize that it is their lack of trust, not only in each other, but in their entire relationship. As friends, they can be unshakeable about their convictions and hold on to some traditional values together, but as soon as they start a romantic relationship, both of them seem to start feeling trapped.\\r\\n\\r\\nVirgo doesn’t look like a zodiac sign that will easily feel trapped, but their mutable quality makes them impatient and always in search for change. They cannot be held in one place for long, any more than a Sagittarius can. The main difference being the degree of sacrifice they are willing to make. Out of these emotions, both partners will start feeling the need to be with someone different, and this is a relationship with probably the biggest potential for adultery, unless incredible guilt stops them first. Communication followed by mutual respect is their only chance of building a trustful bond."},"Intellect":{"Value":65,"Description":"There is so much to say when Virgo and Sagittarius come together, and even though these partners might spark each other’s need to talk excessively, all the time, they will both feel quite good about it. If they hit the zone of real understanding, they will be excited about the use of their minds and the beautiful conclusions and philosophy they can create together. Virgo will bring all the little pieces into their intellectual connection, while a Sagittarius will have vision and help create a bigger picture. Even though they don’t complement each other anywhere close to their opposing signs, the intellectual excitement will be equally important to them from the start.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most relevant fact for these partners to remember is that their respect is the most important thing to hold on to. If they disrespect one another, Virgo will observe their Sagittarius partner as a weirdo, stupid enough to run away from anything that has depth, while Sagittarius will look at their Virgo partner as a weirdo, stupid enough to hold on to irrelevant things. They need to remember that each of them has a different role, and that for each role, these “stupid” characteristics represent the best possible base."},"Emotions":{"Value":10,"Description":"This is not exactly a couple that will often end up in a happily ever after, even though they both wish to find the right person for this more than anything. In most cases, their vision of a fairytale ending differs too much for them to have it with one together. Still, in some rare situations, their mutable natures allow them to move in the same pace with enough respect to stay in an emotional bond that satisfies them both.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth of these partners are considered unemotional, but this is mostly because of their need to rationalize, analyze and use their minds to explain everything that happens to them, rather than rely on their hearts or gut feelings. This will often be a problem, for Virgo needs someone truly emotional so they can show their own deep feelings. Sagittarius seems to be uninterested in needs of Virgo or simply unaware of them because they act as if they are purely rational. The trick here is for both partners to see behind the act in order to find each other’s hearts and understand what they can expect from one another."},"Values":{"Value":50,"Description":"Virgo and Sagittarius will strangely have similar values based on their mutable quality. This is why they will both treasure someone able to adapt, change and move, which is definitely something they will find in each other as they start their relationship. As highly mental signs, they will also both value clarity of mind and intelligence, in general. Still, their approach to intellectual value is different, and as much as Virgo values depth and detailed analysis, Sagittarius will value the width of one’s mind. Even though they differ in other things they value greatly, Virgo valuing practicality and Sagittarius vision and focus, there is enough common ground here for both of them to feel good when together."},"Activities":{"Value":35,"Description":"Virgo and Sagittarius will strangely have similar values based on their mutable quality.

There are many challenges in their way, the biggest being their emotional lack of understanding and their possible lack of respect. Still, when they find a way to show emotions and share them in the same pace and in an understandable way, they could actually have a lot of fun together. Their communication is often exciting and they both have a lot to say to each other, but their rationality may distract them from an actual search for love. If they discover how well they complement each other, they might be able to stay together for a long time.\\r\\n\\r\\n"}},"Capricorn":{"Love":{"Value":65,"Description":"A sexual connection between a Virgo and a Capricorn might be great if they both weren’t so stiff and strict when it comes to sex. Even though they don’t lack the patience or the understanding for each other, there always seems to be just that one shred of pure emotion missing in their contact. Very often these partners don’t get to have sex, because they will have more reason not to, than to give in.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe beauty of their sex life, when they manage to synchronize, is in the depth both partners are capable of, that directly links to the depth of emotions they will show through the act of sex. Their main goal is to find someone who doesn’t take sex lightly, someone who is not superficial toward them and cherishes them as they should be cherished. There is a certain shyness to both of them, and this is something that will make them go crazy for one another, if they only reach the point behind the rational distance they normally share.\\r\\n\\r\\nVirgo will bring enough change to their sex life, as a mutable sign, ready to experiment with someone who is so reliable and respectful. This is a perfect relationship for both partners to relax and try out new things, if they find a way to open up in the beginning."},"Trust":{"Value":99,"Description":"Capricorn is a sign that can be trusted, and Earth signs understand this best. There is nothing shady about them, nothing unreliable or quick to turn to deceit. Virgo usually has no reason to be unfaithful, except when they suffer from their own lack of faith and emotion that cannot be controlled. Even if this is the case, a Capricorn partner will inspire them to be the best they can be, and as faithful as possible. They will need some time to get used to each other’s habits and build the trust they both wish for. When they do, they will rarely break it for anyone or anything else.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Intellect":{"Value":90,"Description":"When someone from the Air or the Fire realm observes these two as they talk, this conversation might seem extremely boring. The flow between Earth signs in its clearest form is sometimes unbearable for other zodiac signs and this is something Virgo and Capricorn truly enjoy. The depth of mind in both of these signs will fascinate them at first, excite them and make their communication incredibly interesting and informative. They both like a good, respectful debate, and in each other, they can find a perfect adversary.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are signs that make one cycle of communication complete, Virgo deciding what’s next to discuss and Capricorn deciding when the subject is resolved. They are like a perfect mechanism, like gears fitting in together to solve any equation the world has to give. Their passion lies within these roles and when they find an understanding in other areas of their relationship, the intellectual one can be stimulating to the point of absolute bliss. This is a couple who knows that any problem is there to be solved and anything broken is there to be fixed."},"Emotions":{"Value":65,"Description":"Both of these signs are considered unemotional. Virgo brings Venus to its fall and Capricorn is the sign of the Moon’s detriment. They do have some emotional issues, but not the same ones, and this helps them find an approach to each other that they both understand. Their relationship needs time, most of all, and the emotions between them need to build, just like trust. With the calm, practical, physical passion rising between them, both partners start building their confidence. With confidence, they feel much more liberated to experiment in life and sex, and this gives true quality to all of the areas of their relationship.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most incredible thing this couple shares is their discovery of one another. In time, they will peel layer by layer from each other’s hearts, and be more and more fascinated by what none of them noticed before. Just like a mathematical equation, they represent a mystery box to each another, and they need to open it, bow by bow, side by side, until they unravel the treasure hidden inside it.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Values":{"Value":80,"Description":"Both Virgo and Capricorn will value calm, rational behavior and choices, and one’s ability to remain smart however unbearable the situation might be. They value depth and this is something they will find incredibly soothing in one another, for they will both feel like they don’t need to pretend to be shallow anymore. They will both value practicality, grounding, money and rational investments. The main difference they have to resolve here is in the value of Capricorn’s goals, for they might be ready to do too much from Virgo’s point of view, in order to reach them. In return, Capricorn doesn’t understand Virgo’s lack of motivation and their lack of need to claim the leading position."},"Activities":{"Value":65,"Description":"Where Capricorn wants to go up, Virgo wants to go forward. Even though they are both Earth signs and this will allow them to follow each other with the same energy, they don’t connect that well on the choice of places they want to visit. They will both want to go to a history museum and learn a lot of information there, but Capricorn often doesn’t want to deal with doctors, let alone the calorie counting and green tea. There is no other sign to understand Virgo’s need to sacrifice better than Capricorn, but if they don’t feel responsible for their partner’s activities, they will rarely follow them to depression. The most important thing to do here is hold on to positive activities and to a routine that makes them both healthy and happy."},"Summary":{"Value":77,"Description":"Virgo and Capricorn belong to the element of Earth and follow each other’s pace perfectly. Even if everything between them seems too slow for some other zodiac signs, they build respect, trust and love, on the foundation of mutual analysis and detailed examination. The search for perfection can be ended in this relationship, for they give each other enough time, and listen to each other well enough to meet the expectations that need to be met. Both of these partners can be stiff and lose sight of the importance of the emotional, mellow approach to life, and this relationship can make them rough and too strict. Still, in most cases, they will give each other enough time to grow out of this and grow old together."}},"Aquarius":{"Love":{"Value":1,"Description":"This is in no way an easy sexual relationship and unless some strong support is provided by their natal charts, Virgo and Aquarius will rarely be attracted to each other enough to start a sexual relationship at all. Their natures find it very hard to support each other, they are both intellectual but in a completely different way, and they will probably ruin any chance of a good sexual relationship by overthinking everything, each of them in their own direction.\\r\\n\\r\\nAquarius really holds on to their spontaneity, but who’s to say what does “spontaneity” really mean? They are rational when it comes to sex, and yet spontaneous? That sounds strange, doesn’t it? The truth is, they choose when to be spontaneous and their intellectual strength often gives them the image of spontaneity because they’ve seen the result faster than other, “not-so-spontaneous” people. This could ruin their sex life, because Virgo is one of those people and will usually think long and hard about starting a sexual relationship.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverthinking is a true turn-off for Aquarius, although they do it too just in a quicker pace, and they will rarely find Virgo’s analysis sexy in any way. Shy, thoughtful, sensitive Virgo will have trouble understanding their nude, weird and often too fast Aquarius partner. It is almost certain that none of them will have enough patience to build their sex life with someone so different from what they need."},"Trust":{"Value":50,"Description":"Their rational natures usually connect them in a trusting relationship, because they both find it stupid to lie or not trust their partner. Although Virgo can be tough on trust, with Aquarius it is obvious even to Virgo that a lack of trust would lead nowhere. Still, there is a great chance they will drift apart, even when their first contact is passionate and strong, because they could simply start feeling that both of them need someone different. If they want to hold on to their mutual trust, they need to keep their relationship fresh and accept each other for exactly who they are."},"Intellect":{"Value":40,"Description":"Virgo is ruled by Mercury and has a mutable quality to it, which gives it this changeable, moveable and adaptable nature. Aquarius has no trouble dealing with Mercury, in most situations, and will most certainly like this adaptable Virgo quality. As a fixed sign, Aquarius is usually set in their ways and this can be difficult to handle for someone so willing to sacrifice their happiness, such as Virgo. Their communication should mostly be good and their topics similar. They will share interest in many things and usually be excited about similar details.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, they belong to the most different elements of all – to Earth and Air. As an Earth sign, Virgo can be very slow, too thorough and rarely inspired enough for Aquarius to even feel the need to share their ideas with them. On the other hand, Aquarius can seem unrealistic or even crazy to their Virgo partner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best way for Virgo and Aquarius to function and be satisfied with their relationship, is to take each other seriously enough. With Virgo’s attention to detail, any plan for Aquarius’ brilliant mind to come to life is possible. Their communication might be tricky and the lack of compassion Aquarius suffers from will sometimes hurt Virgo, but they still have a great opportunity to combine their minds and form a universal intelligence capable of creating anything at all."},"Emotions":{"Value":35,"Description":"The emotional rollercoaster Aquarius gladly offers is something Virgo will probably despise. In case they do fall in love, they will have to deal with a constant fight for freedom and routine. Virgo is a sign of health and our daily routine, and its representatives can often be obsessed by their every meal or every checkup they’ve had with their doctor. Aquarius will in most cases avoid doctors at all costs and the fact that they exalt Neptune will mostly turn them to all sorts of alternative medicine, rather than anything typical that Virgo might hold on to.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe entire emotional world of their relationship could come down to Virgo worrying for their irresponsible Aquarius partner, and the lack of gratitude they might get in return. In fact, Aquarius usually doesn’t need to be taken care of in this way. This is a complicated emotional relationship because the worrying of Virgo degrades the personality of Aquarius and the best of intentions could have damaging consequences.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe biggest problem in the relationship of Virgo and Aquarius is in the fact they both heavily rely on their rational mind. This leaves no room for the joy of seduction, love and satisfaction, and usually they both need a partner with more warmth, life or emotion to them so they could both be happier."},"Values":{"Value":30,"Description":"Virgo and Aquarius will both value intelligence and a clear mind most of all. This doesn’t mean they will find the same people, actions or thoughts intelligent and they could often have opposite opinions on someone in their surroundings. Still, they could motivate each other to develop their intellectual strengths and hold on to this asset if other things in their relationship aren’t that good.

However, Virgo is too cautious and predictable and most of the time they will have trouble fitting in that Aquarius\' too exciting, unpredictable world."},"Summary":{"Value":30,"Description":"Virgo can represent everything that Aquarius runs from – practical, worried about health and earthly things, down to Earth, cleaning obsessed maniac. Imagine how incredibly irresponsible, chaotic and unrealistic Aquarius looks to them. Their strongest meeting point is in their rationality and communication, and this can be used to overcome many problems that their differences result in.

If they take each other seriously, they might create incredible things together, as their great minds merge."}},"Pisces":{"Love":{"Value":99,"Description":"Virgo and Pisces are opposing signs and their attraction is very strong. Since they also represent the axis of Venus’ fall and exaltation, we can conclude that their relationship always has a lesson on Venus to teach. These partners have a task to find the place of physical intimacy in which they will both be relaxed to be exactly who they are.\\r\\n\\r\\nVirgo partner will usually be shy, trying to show their sexuality through rational behavior, and Pisces will see right through this. On the other hand, Pisces will fear close physical connection with another person, and this will be practically dismissed by Virgo. As they both learn that they cannot hide who they are, they will have no choice but to set themselves free from any fear and shame, giving in to the wonderful sexual experience Venus has to offer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a couple that will never have instinctive sex, however passionate they might get. Virgo’s analytical mind wouldn’t allow for them to act “like animals”, and this is something that Pisces will find so humanlike and attractive. Virgo will mostly be attracted by the purity of sex with Pisces, who truly approach it as an act of love, free from prejudice and following their inner feeling, wherever it leads."},"Trust":{"Value":65,"Description":"Virgo can have some serious trust issues that Pisces won’t actually help them overcome. In order to have a healthy relationship in which they both trust each other, they will both need to be secure and confident enough to be honest. Both of these partners will easily give in to dishonesty, although their convictions are the opposite of their behavior. It can be torture for both of them if any one of the partners tells a lie. Fortunately, they are both aware that some secrecy might even spark their relationship and give it more passion. This is why they will usually get over small intimacy outbreaks in order to trust each other on a higher level."},"Intellect":{"Value":85,"Description":"They complement each other best through communication and intellectual stimulation. When they start their relationship, they are bound to realize how similar they actually are, even though they seem so different. The mutable quality of their signs will allow them to jump from topic to topic, both of them staying interested in the flow and the outcome of their conversations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best person to pull Virgo out of their obsessive analysis is Pisces, with their smile and their wider picture. Pisces will give their Virgo partner faith, teach them how belief can form reality and help them be free from too much caution and fear from failure. Virgo often has this inner battle in which nothing they know, think or do is good or valuable enough. Pisces are able to inspire and find value in everything in life, and those insecurities and emotional problems of Virgo may seem like something needless that damages the self-esteem of everyone around them. They will do their best to help their partner reach the point of inner security in which they understand their worth. In return, Virgo will help Pisces reach the actual materialization of their incredible talents. They might do so through nagging and constant criticism, but in the end, Pisces will have many things to be thankful for.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot only does this relationship represent the axis of Venus’ exaltation and fall, but it also represents the axis of the exaltation and fall of Mercury. As much as Virgo has trouble with Venus, Pisces have trouble with practical Mercury and their mind can send mixed signals making them lost and confused. Virgo will help them build an inner sense of intellectual security, in return for their emotional one."},"Emotions":{"Value":95,"Description":"There is no other sign in the zodiac that can awaken the emotional depths of Virgo better than Pisces. Understanding between them could reach points of perfection and this is something that both of them will probably be unable to find with anyone else. Still, it is important for them not to build too much expectation around this idea of perfection, for no one can meet these requirements in real life.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they go astray, losing touch with their partner’s true personality, they will easily get disappointed and have the need to end their relationship. With two mutable signs everything moves fast and changes are inevitable. If they want to remain in a stable relationship, they need to find a fine balance between rationality and emotion, reality and dreams and love each other as if they were perfect just the way they are."},"Values":{"Value":75,"Description":"They share a great love of perfection. As much as Virgo will value one’s perfect mind, Pisces will value a perfect emotion. This is their meeting point and it can make them divine, or constantly dissatisfied with the need to change everything about their partner. Both of these partners will value flexibility, someone’s ability to adapt and change, and they will most certainly value the love they get from their partner. Still, their differences in approach to one’s beliefs and convictions might be huge, and acceptance between them needs to be unconditional.They share a great love of perfection.

When these partners are together, they make each other feel like anything is possible, for Pisces understand endless possibilities as much as Virgo makes things come true, understanding reality better than many others."},"Summary":{"Value":86,"Description":"Virgo and Pisces represent the axis of the exaltation and fall of both Venus and Mercury. This makes them partners with greatest challenges and the greatest potential for love in the entire zodiac. They need to find a fine balance of rationality and emotions, each one individually and together through their relationship. In many cases this is not a couple that will last very long, as their mutable quality makes them changeable enough to disregard the entire relationship quickly if they aren’t satisfied. They need to realize that perfection they seek might not be presented in the form they expect. If they stay together for long enough to understand the benefits of their contact, they might discover that the love between them is the only true love they could find in this lifetime."}}},"Libra":{"Aries":{"Love":{"Value":80,"Description":"Although Aries and Libra are both signs of masculine nature, they are a primal opposition of the zodiac and present a relationship between Mars and Venus, planets in charge of our sex life. When they engage in intimate relations, it is expected for all their libido and possible problems with sexual expression to surface. Attraction they feel toward each other is great, but their signs combined present passive-aggressive behavior in general and as a couple they could have a tendency to hurt each other in intimate relations.\\r\\n\\r\\nRuled by Mars, Aries is a sign of Saturn’s debilitation and Libra exalts it, so their main issue is the lack of emotion and poor boundaries when it comes to sex. Saturn can cool things a bit too much and be a challenge to overcome in their attempts to get sincerely close. When they connect through real emotion and respect each other’s boundaries, they have a potential for a very good sex life, as Aries gives initiative and energy to indecisive Libra, lifting their libido and Libra awakens the fineness of Aries, teaching them how to be selfless lovers and enjoy thinking about the satisfaction of their partner."},"Trust":{"Value":40,"Description":"Trust is not their forte and problems with it could torture them for years. Libra partner has a problem with insecurity in general and needs to show their worth through relationships with different people. They love to be loved and seem to be hungry for the approval of those around them. Aries finds this stupid but easily gets jealous and threaten their mutual sense of stability and belief in other person’s choices.\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to Libra’s lack of confidence, it is also possible that they will doubt everything their partner does. Since Aries doesn’t put much time or thought into their actions, the lack of conversation about every single detail from their personal life could easily arise suspicion in the mind of a Libra. The most important thing here is for Libra to work on their self-esteem and keep their focus on their own life instead of trying to blend into the life of their partner."},"Intellect":{"Value":55,"Description":"Aside from possible conflicts Libra tries to flee from most of the time, their communication usually serves to feed the hungry Sun of a Libra partner, or Aries’ hungry Saturn. Their opposition covers the points of debilitation and exaltation of Saturn and Sun, and this is mainly shown in their communication and everyday functioning. This means that their role in each other’s life is quite simple – Aries needs to boost their Libra partner’s spirits all the time, showing them how capable and brave they can be, while Libra takes on the responsibilities of their Aries partner and shows them how to reach a certain goal. All of this can be quite tiresome at times, especially if one of them has a problem with this unconditional role play, or doesn’t recognize the effort of their partner.\\r\\n\\r\\nMostly they will talk about their daily activities and events since they don’t share many interests. While talking about different activities and people, they find a common language as Aries helps Libra not to obsess about others and Libra helps Aries to understand different views than their own. Their communication might be great if they were in the same profession or at least share a workplace, because that would cover the basic interests they share and give them more space to find the middle between their opinions."},"Emotions":{"Value":99,"Description":"As crazy as this may seem with lack of qualities their relationship might suffer, this is a couple that understands each other very well when it comes to emotions. Aries can awake Libra’s ability to show them because of their own openness. This is something every Libra needs, as they have trouble letting their guard down. Libra, on the other hand, has enough depth to look inside Aries personality instead of superficially examining their behavior. Of all the zodiac signs, Libra is probably one of the few that have good understanding of the nature of Aries. They don’t understand their actions and their way of display of emotion, but the core of emotion and sensitive personality is easy to reach from their perspective.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is safe to say that this is a couple that could solve any issue with love they have for each other and although their troubles could be great, this is possibly such a deep emotional connection that all problems fade next to it."},"Values":{"Value":70,"Description":"Our values set the direction that leads us to our goal for personal development. Aries has a goal in the sign of Capricorn for this is the sign in their tenth house. Capricorn is ruled by Saturn that exalts in Libra. In the practical sense, this means that Libra helps Aries achieve their goals, while following necessary values. This is an interesting observation because the sign of Aries is the sign of Saturn’s debilitation and doesn’t seem to understand the set of values or exact steps that would lead them to their goal. It is almost as if Libra knew the way for Aries to reach their goals by discovering new values in relationship with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general, their individual values are different in so many ways, but it is exactly the purpose of their relationship to question them and set them straight. Aries values direct, energized approach and outspoken people. Libra values tact, fineness and prestige. While Aries gives their best to live in the now, Libra examines the past to set distant targets in the future. They have a lot to learn from each other, but if they do, they might just set their mutual values somewhere in the middle."},"Activities":{"Value":30,"Description":"This is the couple that finds it very difficult to coordinate their activities. They want to do opposite things most of the time, and the only activity they always agree on sharing is sexual activity. Although this is a pillar for a good relationship and everything else they cannot share might seem irrelevant for some time, they need to find a way to do something else they both enjoy. Even if they don’t, their relationship might work, but only if Libra partner lets go of their idea that they need to include their partner in everything they do. Aries could help Libra by supporting their independence in any possible way, while accepting involvement in a part of activities Libra cares about.  \\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Summary":{"Value":62,"Description":"However difficult it might be to reconcile these two natures, remember that this is a primal opposition that represents partners by signification. Aries and Libra are the couple of the zodiac, as much as any other opposing signs, for they are each other’s seventh house, house of relationships. Even more so if we acknowledge the fact that Libra is the sign of relationships in general. Any problem they might have with each other is something to be worked on, because it shows what their personal problem with any relationship is. When they are madly attracted to each other and fall in love, there is almost nothing that could separate them, no matter the differences. Wouldn’t we all like to find the middle ground with our loved one? They need to work on their bond, that’s a fact, but their relationship is a promise of a perfect fit of two souls meant to be together."}},"Taurus":{"Love":{"Value":35,"Description":"The relationship between Taurus and Libra has a special kick to it, since both signs are ruled by Venus, but represent its completely different characteristics. While Taurus loves to be comfortable and relies on their sense of touch and taste, Libra will want everything pretty and rely on their eyesight and the sense of smell. They do connect in a way, but in most cases they have this different approach to Venus as a planet of sexual pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main difference between these signs is in their exalting planet. Taurus exalts the Moon and Libra exalts Saturn. It is like they adore opposite things and while Taurus will care for emotions and tenderness in a sexual relationship, Libra will rely on its depth and good timing. It will not be easy for them to understand what the other person wants and they could both end up seeming needy to one another – Taurus to Libra because of their emotional neediness and Libra to Taurus because of their physical one.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever different they might be, they are still two signs ruled by Venus and can be fairly attracted to each other. As a feminine and a masculine sign, they could mend their differences and try to learn about “the other side of Venus” instead of expecting the impossible from one another. They are both gentle lovers who like their relationships without stress and drama, so with enough patience they could be a really good fit."},"Trust":{"Value":30,"Description":"Taurus’ trust can be damaged with Libra’s need to be liked by everyone, especially if they are not sure if they want to be with their Taurus partner in the first place. If Libra can’t make this basic decision, the uncertainty would be a punch for the ego of Taurus and it will be very hard to recover after they realize they are not wanted with certainty.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven if they are Libra’s first choice, there is still a matter of flirting with so many other people. With really insecure Libra specimens, it is almost impossible to have a trusting relationship, for their need for acceptance can go a long way and even suck them into unfaithfulness. Their quality however, is in their outlook on justice, and they will rarely act on their insecurities, but still, who could be sure when the vibe is so unstable, especially when someone as stable as Taurus tries to blend in.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Intellect":{"Value":5,"Description":"These two will drive each other crazy. On one hand you would have Taurus, never doubting their character, never moving and annoyingly unchangeable. On the other, you would have Libra, indecisive and never certain of what they want. It seems impossible for them not to jump on each other’s nerves daily.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main challenge here is their primary opinion on each other. As two sides of Venus, these signs represent a peasant girl (Taurus) and a city lady (Libra). When you combine this with the fact that Libra has a fallen Sun, their ego problem would easily make them feed on their refined, city image and they could criticize the “peasant girl” for her lack of style and her rusticity. They simply don’t understand that the fact that Taurus likes things comfortable doesn’t always reflect on their lack of style and can’t accept the differences in their appearance.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou could say that this is quite superficial, but it is actually a really deep problem with insecurity. Libra is not criticizing Taurus because they are such a fine person, but because they are afraid they are not. Taurus will easily get insecure because of this critical view and dip into their guilt trip, almost as if they always searched for someone to wake the guilt in them, but without the ability to change and accept criticism as constructive. Even if this is not something any of them will say out loud, it can be felt in their relationship, even by those around them."},"Emotions":{"Value":25,"Description":"If they are attracted to each other just enough they could fall crazy in love, but in most cases, they are both too careful to end up in a loving relationship. Although Taurus and Libra both are looking for someone to sweep them off their feet, they will rarely have this with each other. Taurus will usually decide not to give enough space for Libra to discover them, while Libra will spend too much time looking for faults. As signs ruled by Venus, they are both complemented by signs ruled by Mars and normally look for a partner with initiative, to have a fast, exciting start and not get enough time to think things over."},"Values":{"Value":40,"Description":"Venus, their ruler, represents value itself, so we could say that they value same things because of the similarities shown through what their ruler likes or not, but in different ways. Of course they both want true, magical, mystical love with Venus exalted in Pisces, but Taurus values tenderness and touch on their way to get there, while Libra values responsibility and seriousness. However, their final goals are the same and they do value one’s ability to love them, most of all. This could be their real point of connection if they do fall in love with one another.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Activities":{"Value":65,"Description":"It is not hard to find activities to share for this couple, for as long as they are not boring to one of them. Although Taurus doesn’t really have to go to matinees and art shows with no soul, they could have a nice time at a cozy art gallery where art work in warm colors is exhibited. Libra will rarely go for a walk in the mud, but they could make a tour downtown, where they could both be seen wearing their new outfits. With their mutual love for beautiful things and love in general, they will find a nice way to spend their time together if they are open enough to make some changes to their usual routine."},"Summary":{"Value":33,"Description":"Look out Libras, for Taurus is here to wake your inner fears and bring them all to surface! Taurus should be careful, too, for their need to feel guilt could blossom with a Libra. This relationship is a lesson both of them will never forget, especially if they manage to build enough understanding and tenderness between them. The only way they could ever be happy would be to embrace what they don’t want to deal with in their"}},"Gemini":{"Love":{"Value":80,"Description":"Gemini and Libra are both guided by the element of Air and this should give them a good start for their mental connection and verbal understanding. When it comes to sex, this is a plus, for they will both be free to communicate anything that bothers or satisfies them. Fragile ego of Libra can be lifted by Gemini’s charm and approach to sex. They seem to know how to make everything a little less serious and this will help their Libra partner open up and share their emotions through sex, too. When Gemini partner sees how mellow Libra can be, although they seem so tactful and cold, they won’t have much choice but to share emotions as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main goal in their sexual life is, in fact, to balance these emotions. Libra is a sign ruled by Venus, sexual, sensual and seductive, while Gemini is ruled by Mercury, having no sexual or emotional wisdom. The basis of a good sex life between them is their curiosity, for Libra is always curious about their partner, as much as Gemini is curious about everything else. Although Libra might be indecisive, Gemini won’t have a problem thinking of a different approach and finding new techniques, words and adventures to spice up their sexual encounters.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Trust":{"Value":95,"Description":"When Libra decides to be with someone, even if it is after a long, hard inner battle, they will probably believe in their words and their actions. When they choose a partner, they choose them for their character and their straightforward nature. Libra has no reason to doubt their own judgment and will probably believe their Gemini in every case, except when their dishonesty is too obvious. In return, Gemini will respect Libra’s need to flirt in order to be accepted and loved by other people. Not only will they not find this threatening, but they will actually enjoy a consequence of this behavior – their own freedom."},"Intellect":{"Value":60,"Description":"Gemini partner is very opinionated and Libra has a tendency to take a lot of things their partner says as a personal insult. Although Gemini will, in most cases, just follow their rational nature and comment on things simply because they want to talk, it will be hard on Libra to overcome some of the things they might say. The sign of Libra is very sensitive to any sort of will imposing or criticism and will recognize it even when Gemini has no idea what their partner is imagining. Who’s to say which one of them is right?\\r\\n\\r\\nSince no two people can agree on everything every time each of them opens their mouth to speak, Gemini and Libra can have a very hurtful and tough communication due to the mutual lack of tolerance. Gemini partner would rather go blind than accept that they have a lack of tolerance, but the truth is they can be quite strict when it comes to someone’s mental activity and their opinions. Libra is in most cases hurt enough by the pressure on their personality produced in their primal family, so they will have a very bad response to this behavior even if Gemini meant nothing wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main issue here is in the fact that Gemini lives to learn and teach what they have learned. They often present themselves as someone who knows things, and Libra can see this as their need to prove their intellectual dominance. Even though this isn’t their intention in most cases, sometimes a single sentence Gemini said can be something Libra feels hurt by for years to come. Libra can learn from a teacher, from someone who has proven their worth, but hardly from their know-it-all partner."},"Emotions":{"Value":90,"Description":"The way Libra’s emotions develop is something really suitable for Gemini. They seem to be in sync while Libra partner searches for depth, and Gemini flies around looking for a new discovery. They won’t even notice as love between them starts to show, one of them running around and the other thinking about reasons why they wouldn’t be perfect together.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe could say that neither of them is very emotional, but Libra is ruled by Venus, so there is a strong link to an emotional plain here. The problem develops when they both talk too much about their emotions, while none of them stops to actually feel. They can remain detached and distant, unless Libra falls in love deeply enough to follow their Gemini partner wherever they go, and Gemini falls in love deeply enough for all words to lose meaning."},"Values":{"Value":55,"Description":"While Libra will value consistency and someone being responsible and reliable, Gemini will be very different from this, with opposing values as well. Gemini will value someone’s creativity and intellectual strength and this is something Libra can’t respond to if their Sun is in its lowest state. Their meeting point is in their value of intellect, however strange it may seem. They are both Air signs and give a lot of attention to their partner’s mental personality and the way they think. They could find a way to tease each other with words, seduce each other with words, seduce each other and in the end find a way to communicate everything else – in case they both care enough."},"Activities":{"Value":85,"Description":"Libra is your typical activity chameleon when they fall in love. They want to examine the world of their partner, beginning to end, and will gladly follow them around in all their activities expecting the same in return. However, this can end in an unfortunate way, leaving Libra with their energy drained and wishes not granted. Gemini just doesn’t care about following their partner only because they want to be followed. Both of them need to keep their expectations low and let their partner surprise them by something new and exciting. They will enjoy various activities together, but in order to do so, they need to respect each other’s limits and desires to begin with.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Summary":{"Value":78,"Description":"Gemini and Libra partners are not exactly always a perfect couple, although their signs support each other. If Libra partner has trouble being alone and doing things by themselves, this isn’t something Gemini will easily understand. Due to their lack of personal boundaries, Libra representatives will often let their Gemini partners lead the way until all of their energy is gone, they feel like they should only lie down and turn their brain off. If they want to work on their relationship and be happy, Libra needs to respect their Gemini partner enough to let them be their teacher, lover and a friend. In return, Gemini will have to take care of their Libra partner, respecting their limits and their need for togetherness."}},"Cancer":{"Love":{"Value":40,"Description":"At first glance Cancer and Libra might seem as if they are really far apart. Both signs have trouble accepting Mars and this leads to a lack of passion and initiative in their sex life. However, the tactful and careful nature of Libra can really soothe Cancer. This is mostly because of the fact that Saturn, the ruler of Cancer’s opposing sign, is exalted in Libra. Although some initiative might be lacking, there is a chance for Cancer and Libra to function very well in their sex life if they spend enough time together.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem with their sexual connection is in their element, more than anything else. Cancer belongs to the element of Water and Libra is an Air sign. Although Libra partner might be extremely patient and nice, there is still a speed to the element of Air that Cancer might have trouble adjusting to.\\r\\n\\r\\nThings they would like to try out will differ greatly, for Cancer needs emotional connection and Libra needs contact, touch and experience before they get too emotional. Libra is not often inspired by the nature of Cancer and won’t normally fall in love with them at first sight.

While Cancer wants a quiet family life with no interference from other people, Libra can’t seem to stay away from other people, seeking their affection and approval day after day. At some point their Cancer partner has to ask themselves if this is the kind of partner they want to have children with.

This can easily lead to a lack of trust in Libra, especially if the Sun is in final degrees of the sign."},"Intellect":{"Value":50,"Description":"As signs ruled by Venus and the Moon, it is safe to presume that their relationship is in a way very important. Although Libra is in charge for the upper, spiritual nature of Venus, it is still a sign of relationships and the Moon will only emphasize the need for closeness and harmony. Their communication will not be too difficult, but there is a chance they won’t share many interests or respect each other enough for it to have true quality.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir main problem could surface if they start making unrealistic plans together. The expectations of Cancer with Capricorn as their opposing sign would be extremely practical and strict. Libra does exalt Saturn, but it is not an Earth sign, and usually they remain in the field of ideas instead of a practical approach to materialization. Cancer doesn’t understand how someone can be so far from reality and this could lead to a strange passive conflict that could endanger their entire relationship. Cancer needs to realize that Libra has its place among the Air signs, in the field of ideas - not necessarily their realization.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is important to remember that Libra has a troubled Sun and usually looks for a partner with more fire and passionate energy than Cancer normally has. However ugly that might sound, they need someone to feed on, and they normally have strong relationships with fire signs which produce enough energy even for their loved ones, or Air signs who don’t really care about it. The sign of Cancer unconsciously calculates and distributes energy to their inner priority list, and they will rarely have an excess big enough to shower Libra in it."},"Emotions":{"Value":15,"Description":"Both Moon and Venus represent emotions, and they are both highly emotional signs. However, their emotional context is very different, for Cancer is looking for a love on Earth and Libra is looking for someone to take to heaven. This is exactly where the spiritual side of Libra’s Venus takes away their true chance to share a life together. It is a Venus that doesn’t need to eat or sleep, for as long as it feels the unique, balanced love. Cancer will understand this idea to some point, but probably look for a more grounded partner when they realize that this is a pattern that isn’t about to change.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs two cardinal signs, they could have a long unsatisfying relationship because they are both waiting for a groundbreaking moment to set them free. In some cases they should be advised to make a change if they are not satisfied, and search for someone who could make them happier."},"Values":{"Value":20,"Description":"As both of them are signs of relationships – family relationships or relationships with partners – they will both value a pleasant and joyful connection between two people. If they find it with each other, they will certainly have trouble letting it go, both of them understanding that it is not that easy to find.

That doesn\'t sound promising, does it?"},"Activities":{"Value":10,"Description":"Cancer and Libra could do many things together, but it is questionable if they will want to. Cancer is a sign that exalts Jupiter and although they can be perfectly happy with a grumpy partner, they would appreciate them not to have a need to impose their grumpiness on them. There is a secret desire to every Cancer to travel the world, while having the safe base to come home to, but Libra could destruct their beliefs and lead them to doubt they simply don’t want to deal with. With Cancer’s mild and mellow temperament, Libra will probably feel even more inadequate and grumpy, for they need someone to be their opposition and defy them in order to have respect and sexual charge.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Summary":{"Value":28,"Description":"Probably the biggest restriction in the relationship between Cancer and Libra is in things they want from their partner. Cancer wants someone responsible, to take them by the hand if needed and complement their emotional nature with practicality. Libra wants someone who is full of life, energized, strong and full of initiative to follow their ideas. They can really disappoint each other if any expectations are set wrongly at the beginning of their relationship. The best way for them to build a love that is to last, is for both partners to hold on to their independence whatever happens.

The sign of Cancer unconsciously calculates and distributes energy to their inner priority list, and they will rarely have an excess big enough to shower Libra in it."},"Emotions":{"Value":15,"Description":"Both Moon and Venus represent emotions, and they are both highly emotional signs. However, their emotional context is very different, for Cancer is looking for a love on Earth and Libra is looking for someone to take to heaven. This is exactly where the spiritual side of Libra’s Venus takes away their true chance to share a life together. It is a Venus that doesn’t need to eat or sleep, for as long as it feels the unique, balanced love. Cancer will understand this idea to some point, but probably look for a more grounded partner when they realize that this is a pattern that isn’t about to change.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs two cardinal signs, they could have a long unsatisfying relationship because they are both waiting for a groundbreaking moment to set them free. In some cases they should be advised to make a change if they are not satisfied, and search for someone who could make them happier."},"Values":{"Value":20,"Description":"As both of them are signs of relationships – family relationships or relationships with partners – they will both value a pleasant and joyful connection between two people. If they find it with each other, they will certainly have trouble letting it go, both of them understanding that it is not that easy to find. However, their entire system of values differs greatly beyond the point of relationships, and while Cancer will value tenderness and care, Libra will value responsibility and platonic love. That doesn\'t sound promising, does it?"},"Activities":{"Value":10,"Description":"Cancer and Libra could do many things together, but it is questionable if they will want to. Cancer is a sign that exalts Jupiter and although they can be perfectly happy with a grumpy partner, they would appreciate them not to have a need to impose their grumpiness on them. There is a secret desire to every Cancer to travel the world, while having the safe base to come home to, but Libra could destruct their beliefs and lead them to doubt they simply don’t want to deal with. With Cancer’s mild and mellow temperament, Libra will probably feel even more inadequate and grumpy, for they need someone to be their opposition and defy them in order to have respect and sexual charge.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Summary":{"Value":28,"Description":"Probably the biggest restriction in the relationship between Cancer and Libra is in things they want from their partner. Cancer wants someone responsible, to take them by the hand if needed and complement their emotional nature with practicality. Libra wants someone who is full of life, energized, strong and full of initiative to follow their ideas. They can really disappoint each other if any expectations are set wrongly at the beginning of their relationship. The best way for them to build a love that is to last, is for both partners to hold on to their independence whatever happens. If they focus on love and worry about earthly things each on their own, Cancer could “compromise” on heavenly love, as much as Libra would like to have a family."}},"Virgo":{"Love":{"Value":1,"Description":"The sexual relationship between a Virgo and a Libra just doesn’t seem like a good choice. Virgo is an Earth sign ruled by Mercury, relying highly on their intellect, while bringing Venus to its fall. Libra is an Air sign ruled by Venus, and couldn’t be more distant from Virgo’s shy nature or practicality when it comes to sex. They will probably be driven crazy by each other, one of them trying obsessively to keep things clean and looking as if they were scared of any emotional contact, and the other strict in their search for spiritual love and a partner they can really talk to.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost often, they are not even attracted to each other, and when they do begin a sexual relationship they have to face the challenge of speed. Virgo will want to move slowly, and even though their mutable quality makes them pretty adaptable, it is often not enough to reach Libra’s speed of Air. They might find a middle though, when Libra relies on their exaltation of Saturn and slows down, while Virgo adapts and changes more quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they find their perfect timing, both partners might still end up unsatisfied. Virgo was expecting a fairytale connection seeing the image Libra shows and they will find so many faults in their partner’s approach. Libra’s self-esteem doesn’t really tolerate that much criticism and they will probably see Virgo as boring, stiff and unaware of any emotional connection they wanted to make. For this sexual relationship to work, they need to coordinate the emotions they give and receive. Only then will they be able to satisfy each other."},"Trust":{"Value":25,"Description":"It is a good thing Libra exalts Saturn and their need to be fair is, in many cases, more than obvious. If this wasn’t the case, Virgo would dismiss each word they say to begin with. There is a lot of tension between them, for they don’t understand each other’s primal natures. This is not so much an issue of trust, but it comes down to it when the dust settles. There is no way to explain to shy, introvert Virgo, why Libra has to have everything out in the open. It is even less clear why so much attention must be brought to their relationship, or why does their Libra partner flirt with everyone that looks decent. On the other hand, Libra doesn’t really trust the moodiness of Virgo and think of their partner’s fear of expression as if there is something they want to hide."},"Intellect":{"Value":60,"Description":"They will understand each other perfectly for as long as they speak of taking responsibility and serious matters in life, such as professional choices and their income. This can keep them in a pretty good place for quite some time, especially if they share the same professional interests or have a goal to support each other in learning or advancements of any kind. Even if they touch the subject of emotional contact, they will still see eye to eye for a while. Both of them value rational choices and smart moves.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut then, true emotions will surface in one of these partners, and they might realize that communication between them is no longer possible. As soon as one of them has to deal with a personal issue, the other one seems to freeze, losing all ability for compassion of closeness. The problem here lies in the fact that their relationship is based on their mental connection and this interferes with actually loving one another, and providing a kind word at an important time.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Emotions":{"Value":1,"Description":"Their emotional contact leans on the point of their communication for they are in a strange coexistence. There is no couple more prone to separate emotionally than these two, and this can lead to so much dissatisfaction in both of them, with both partners unable to end the relationship they don’t feel good in.\\r\\n\\r\\nVirgo is a sign where Venus falls and this is the ruler of Libra and a planet that, shoulder to shoulder with the Moon, represents our emotions. The value and stability of emotions that needs to be found by Libra, seems to lose all meaning when rational Virgo comes along. Libra will instantly fit into the expectations of their partner, trying hard to be that voice of reason, more rational than they actually are. As time goes by, the emotions they have kicked away will cumulate, returning in a sudden wave that cannot be stopped. There is no way to control the emotional nature of Libra, and this is something they will both learn in this relationship."},"Values":{"Value":30,"Description":"This is a couple that will value all the same things until they discover that this simply isn’t true. It is a strange deceit that comes between them, as if they were both able to practice something entirely out of their reach. The guilt they will subconsciously feel for dismissing each other’s (and their own) emotions will take out the satisfaction between them and leave them in the state of wonder – how can two people that value so many similar things, value something entirely different by the end of the relationship?"},"Activities":{"Value":65,"Description":"Virgo is a mutable sign and they will adapt to any desire their partner has with ease. Libra is tactful and thoughtful enough for Virgo not to feel bad about their choices. There is rarely anything extreme about their contact and they will mostly enjoy the usual, relationship activities with one another. Even their pace can be synchronized well enough, as Virgo is much faster than the rest of the Earth signs, while Libra’s indecisiveness makes them quite slow. They need to pay special attention when Virgo helps with decision making, taking even more of Libra’s already bruised ego. This can lead to serious problems, not only in deciding on future activities, but in their mutual respect."},"Summary":{"Value":30,"Description":"Virgo and Libra can form a very satisfying intellectual bond, for as long as they respect each other’s feelings. In general, this relationship can sometimes work, and these partners can synchronize their pace, choose appropriate activities and build a satisfying sex life with enough patience and care. They could have a deep problem with emotional understanding though, and the thing they will find most difficult to reconcile is their fragile egos. Virgo, willing to please, will easily take over the responsibilities and decisions that Libra needs to take on. This will lead to a feeling of inferiority in Libra and the loss of respect toward their Virgo partner. If this issue is left unresolved, their relationship might end because of disrespect they were both unaware of in the beginning.\\r\\n\\r\\n"}},"Libra":{"Love":{"Value":65,"Description":"A great thing about the relationship of two Libras is in their understanding of tasteful behavior. They seem to fit perfectly when it comes to not crossing the line and being as moderate in their sexual expression as possible. This will help them build a strong relationship in time, if they don’t start judging each other as soon as one of them jumps out of their strict sexual routine.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs two partners ruled by Venus, they could both easily have a problem with initiative and this might be an obstacle impossible to overcome. When one of them starts relying on the masculine nature of their sign, a relationship can begin and the main objective here becomes satisfying one another. Their mental compatibility will allow them to understand each other’s needs and talk about anything regarding their sex life, but their shared lack of confidence might make them judge each other in a way they wouldn’t judge a different partner."},"Trust":{"Value":35,"Description":"Two Libras don’t even know how many trust issues they have until they get together. The uncertainty of their decisions can be well understood when it comes to everyday things, but as soon as they show it while choosing each other, everything ever said will be questioned. The fall of the Sun gives less light to these individuals, meaning it can be a challenge for them to see things clearly. This doesn’t make them sense things any less, and they will feel something is wrong from a thousand miles distance, not aware what it is. Trust is a very sensitive issue when they get to this point, especially if they don’t speak their mind waiting for resolutions. This is a couple most prone to misunderstandings of all couples in the zodiac."},"Intellect":{"Value":80,"Description":"We can say with certainty that their communication will develop to something they will both enjoy, for as long as they don’t start feeding their bruised egos on one another. When this happens, one of these partners will become fully unaware of their behavior, acting like a vampire that drains willpower from their partner, day after day. In the worst case scenario, both of them will feel powerless all the time, because of the disrespect they feel for each other, but lack initiative and seem unable to resolve the situation that burdens them.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor as long as they respect each other enough, as two Air signs, communication between them will seem endless. They will always have something to share, in most cases talking excessively about other people. When they start pointing to each other’s flaws, it might be best to pull back and realize that nothing truly needs to be changed. Their mutual acceptance is the only thing that can keep their mental relationship in a good spot and their conversations flowing without judgment and unrealistic expectations.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Emotions":{"Value":50,"Description":"On one hand, two signs ruled by Venus seem to be made for love, and this speaks of their physical and spiritual closeness that can be made through their emotional contact. On the other, Libra is a sign that exalts Saturn, and this gives them both a cold side, one that will not easily allow them to build an intimate relationship. The Air element they belong to won’t help much, since they will do their best to rationalize things until they lose any emotional value. Two Libras sometimes make an impression of two people who refuse to be in love, out of social or intellectual expectations that cannot be met.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is that stubbornness in Libra that isn’t obvious at first glance, and if something could tear this couple apart, it is their need to stick to their convictions. As if they are incapable to look at the bigger picture, they will sometimes shove their emotions under the rug, only to hold on to what they know. It is strange how sure of their knowledge and intelligence they can be when they get together, as if they finally found someone that seems weaker. In order to stay together, two Libra partners need to turn off their brains and let go to their feelings and their sexual relations. This is the only way for them to build intimacy, or they might both resist it out of simple fear and lack of confidence.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Values":{"Value":99,"Description":"The combination of Venus’ rule and Saturn’s exaltation makes them share the same values, gathered through similar experiences and relationships. Venus is a planet that speaks of value in general, and this is a strong connecting point to them, especially since both of them lack the awareness of real value of money. These partners value dedication, a spiritual approach to love, fineness and moderate choices, reasonable behavior that will not be judged by those around them. When it comes to this side of their relationship, two Libra representatives seem to be a perfect fit.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Activities":{"Value":80,"Description":"At first glance, we might assume that they will like to show off, inspire others by the love they show to the world and be on the move to create a certain image doing everything side by side. The problem arises before they get to this point, while they try to decide and make an agreement on where to go in the first place. Both of them will want to stick to a certain secure routine, rarely prepared to meet too many new people. But if their routines don’t coincide, they will have to make compromises in order to move from a point of stagnation. When they find a shared routine and share friends, shared activities won’t be a problem anymore and they will follow each other with much more ease.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Summary":{"Value":68,"Description":"The sign of Libra is a sign of relationships and they often have a mission to teach others about relating to one another. When two Libras start dating, it might be difficult for them to find a purpose of their contact, for they both seem to share a mission and a goal that is connected to other people. If they find a meeting point, combining their activities and sticking to their shared values, they will have a tendency to become a perfectly balanced couple. The only thing missing in both of them, very hard to develop, is the sense of mutual respect with no passive judgment or expectations. Both of them are susceptible to this problem with their surroundings, and when together, these problems will easily multiply. If they let each other be who they are, they might become an inspiration for all of us, teaching us what a productive relationship really is."}},"Scorpio":{"Love":{"Value":45,"Description":"This is an intense couple in every way and their sexual relationship is something truly exciting and challenging at the same time. They are linked through their animalistic natures, continuing one another, ruled by planets that also rule their opposing signs. This is a complicated sexual contact, for they are ruled by Venus and Mars, as if they were made for each other. However, they seem to lack the touch of the element they both need, separated by the quick, superficial element of Air in Libra and emotional, slow element of Water in Scorpio.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven if they don’t make each other happy in other parts of their relationship, when a Libra partner lets go to their instinctive, animalistic side, they easily become one with their Scorpio partner. Their sex life can be incredibly emotional and demanding, for the pull of their energies is extremely strong and makes them both obsessive and possessive to one another. They will both often get so tied that their relationship seems impossible to break. These ties are created through their physical contact, even if everything else in their relationship makes them deeply unsatisfied."},"Trust":{"Value":1,"Description":"If Scorpio cannot trust someone, it is Libra. How could they when there seems to be an obvious need in their Libra partner to show how attractive and sensual they are to the rest of the world. As if this wasn’t enough, that possessiveness of Scorpio is easily absorbed by Libra, and they will start acting in a similar way, obsessing about each time their partner wants to do anything alone. Even though this is the worst case scenario, this atmosphere will probably be present in any Libra Scorpio couple on a smaller scale. The question is – are they ready to live like this every day? If they accept this as a way of sharing true, deep love, than their trust issues might not be much of a problem however weird they might seem."},"Intellect":{"Value":55,"Description":"There is nothing Scorpio can say that Libra won’t be able to rationalize. Their communication is the exact place where the connection of Libra to Saturn comes in handy. This will give Libra the ability to slow down, breathe in, and understand the impulsive acts or words of their Scorpio partner. There is just enough depth in both of these signs, even though Libra is an Air sign and quite distant from planet Earth. This will allow just enough understanding between them in a rational sense.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem they have to deal with is in the fact that they both represent a detriment for each other’s rulers. This will easily lead to the dismissal of each other’s personalities, especially since Libra has to deal with personality issues through the fall of the Sun, and Scorpio doesn’t accept anything that isn’t whole. Libra will have trouble understanding the aggressively clear side of Scorpio, as much as Scorpio won’t understand the dishonest act of their Libra partner. Their differences could be very difficult to reconcile if they get too close to each other and start meddling in their personal lives and decisions.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Emotions":{"Value":25,"Description":"There is an incredible intensity to their feelings when they do fall in love. In many cases, love simply won’t happen. Libra looks for an active, fiery partner that will awaken their life force and bring light into their life. Scorpio looks for someone physical, sensual and practical, and although Libra can meet these needs to some point due to Saturn’s exaltation and the rule of Venus, in most cases this is not primarily who they want to be.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a spark exists between them, it will easily build up to a fire, burning entire cities, forests and everyone on its way including both of them. That nuclear energy of Scorpio is ignited by its preceding sign of Libra, because it carries information on all unresolved issues in relationships and all of the anger that hasn’t been let out because of the forced need for appropriate behavior.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn other words, Libra will accumulate the unexpressed sexual energy and it will burst in Scorpio, leading to a lifelong war if enough is pushed under the rug. This will be construed as ultimate love, making their emotional relationship ridiculously intense. They need to understand that love is about tenderness as much as everything else and if they don’t have any, maybe it is not love but simple physical attraction and a need to vent from restrictions.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Values":{"Value":10,"Description":"Both of these partners will value consistency and commitment and this is something that will connect them in the first place. However, the rest of their systems of value don’t coincide that much and they will differ on behavior and expectations of other people. With Libra frowning at indecent behavior, Scorpio will have indecent friends, honest about their act and fully accepted and respected for that. It seems to Libra that Scorpio does everything out of the ordinary just to seem special, while Scorpio sees Libra as doing everything ordinary just to fit in. The main problem here is in the value they give to opinions of other people and this will not be easy to overcome."},"Activities":{"Value":35,"Description":"If there is an activity a Libra and a Scorpio can share all the time, it must be sex. Scorpio will awaken the animalistic side of their Libra partner, and their time together will most certainly be focused on both partners following their instincts. Scorpio is a sign of the exaltation of Uranus and they will lack patience for indecisiveness of Libra. This is why their needs won’t fit very well in other areas of their lives, and they might not be able to meet each other’s expectations. An exception to this rule occurs when Libra turns to the dark side and gives in to the need of Scorpio to take them to the Underworld. No other partner will ignite this need in Scorpio as a Libra partner."},"Summary":{"Value":29,"Description":"The relationship of Libra and Scorpio is in no way easy and light. Both of these partners will have to face their dark sides through this bond, and although this can lead to an incredible and intense sex life, and emotions that no one else can understand, it might lead them both to a depressive hole they won’t easily get out of. The only way for this couple to last in a satisfying and gentle relationship, is for both partners to build a strong individual, independent life, or they will get sucked into the whirlpool of karmic emotions and obsessive, negative expectations."}},"Sagittarius":{"Love":{"Value":90,"Description":"The intensity of emotional contact and intimacy between a Libra and a Sagittarius will mostly depend on other factors in personal charts, but they will most certainly enjoy their sexual relationship. They are a very good match when it comes to sexuality, for no partner here feels pressured and there is just enough room for both of them to grow, develop, build their self-esteem and feel secure in each other’s arms.\\r\\n\\r\\nRuled by two benefic planets, Venus and Jupiter, their main objective is to form an enjoyable sexual relationship, with a primary goal to make each other happy. For this goal, they will experiment a lot, and try out new things, everything followed by a smile and a sense of lightness, as if sex wasn’t really a big deal in the first place. The seriousness of Libra linked to its exaltation of Saturn will give their entire relationship endurance and stability, while their ruling Venus working together with Jupiter, gives enough romance, sexual desire, tenderness and might lead them to a fairytale ending. This combination of planets forms Neptune in a way, and speaks of the growth of satisfaction leading to orgasmic pleasure, even though both signs might not seem at all sexual to some other members of the zodiac.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Trust":{"Value":5,"Description":"As stated above, rulers of Libra and Sagittarius are closely linked to Neptune and the challenge of trust is one of the most important experiences that this relationship gives. They can both go to extremes, either having unrealistic faith in each other or mistrusting every word and every action that is made. The only way to keep the image of trust for these signs seems to be to always stay in a fairytale, unrealistic state, and this is something a Sagittarius will never want to do. If truth isn’t lived, nothing in the world is beautiful for a Sagittarian Sun. As soon as they start their search for something different, Libra will sense the change and become frustrated by their inability to create oneness with a partner they love.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Intellect":{"Value":85,"Description":"It is wonderful to watch how soft Libra gets, forgetting about Saturn and their own responsibility, as Sagittarius’ childish nature melts their heart. Even if this isn’t something with a promising future, for no one can run from their true nature, it will bring them both joy and happiness at least for a little while. Libra partner will be able to relax next to someone who doesn’t judge, and Sagittarius partner will feel like their energy is well focused on someone that needs some youth, warmth, light, optimism and creativity in their life.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor as long as they don’t brush on ego problems, their communication and intellectual compatibility are a given. The main problem that will eventually surface and need to be dealt with, is in the forces of their Suns. Libra’s Sun is weak, and they will easily give the wheel to someone else who will make positive decisions and moves for them. Sagittarius has too much fiery energy in their Sun, active, taking action and always prepared to give some of it even if nobody asked for it in the first place. This could lead to a subtle, hidden, will imposing and a character shift that will leave them both bruised for respect when a light is finally shed on the issue."},"Emotions":{"Value":99,"Description":"This is one of the most compatible couples when it comes to the emotional side of their relationship. It is not easy for any one of them to find love and share it with someone. They are, after all, an Air and a Fire sign. Even though Libra is ruled by Venus, it is linked to the mental processes, social adaptation and communication through its element, while Sagittarius has passionate feelings, but uses their head, spreading their philosophy, more than actually feeling.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they get together, they seem to be able to find a balance in which both of them use their heads just enough, and give each other enough room for love to be born. This is a bond that gives both partners the opportunity to understand how deep their emotions can go, as beneficent rulers make way for feelings to surface in a supporting atmosphere. Even though their relationship is not always meant to be the one they will stay in for life, it could prepare them for a love they seek, giving them a glimpse of what they are capable of."},"Values":{"Value":75,"Description":"These partners will value the strength of mind in a way that is understandable only to them. Libra doesn’t seem like a creative person to others, but a Sagittarius sees their intellect through communication and motivates them to show their warmth. This leads to shared value of their entire relationship and an intellectual understanding that gives them room to build their shared philosophy. Even if they don’t start their relationship in the same place, they will have the opportunity to build similar values in time, showing each other what’s truly important."},"Activities":{"Value":70,"Description":"Even though we could easily assume that a Libra and a Sagittarius will have lots of things to do together, there is a great chance that their choices of activities won’t be so similar. Libra wants to stick to their usual routine, and make fieldtrips to things that interest them from time to time. Sagittarius wants to move from any routine and live a life travelling the world. There are exceptions to this rule, of course, and there are uplifted Libras that will want to travel the world, as much as there are Sagittarius representatives that want to follow a certain trail, while fantasizing about their reality. However, in most cases, their needs won’t fit that well and they will probably face the challenge of their usual ego battle while choosing what to do together."},"Summary":{"Value":71,"Description":"The relationship of Libra and Sagittarius is in most cases a beneficent bond that allows these partners to develop their emotional, inner worlds and build their lives without negative influences. However, there is an archetypal battle between them, for Saturn exalts in Libra and doesn’t really care for his son, Jupiter, the ruler of Sagittarius. This could easily lead to a struggle for supremacy and a battle to reach the ruling position among them. This comes as a continuation of Libra’s bruised Sun and a Sagittarius will fit in perfectly with the need to give away every sense of pride out of some childish convictions. The only way for them to be happy together, is to respect each other fully and let each other do what they are meant to do. Libra should stick to their relationship and love, ruled by Venus, while Sagittarius should stick to their convictions and width, ruled by Jupiter, multiplying the love Libra provides."}},"Capricorn":{"Love":{"Value":15,"Description":"When we are speaking of a sexual relationship between a Libra and a Capricorn, the first thing that comes to mind is waiting. Ruled by Venus and Saturn, they tell the tale of a soldier that had to leave his wife and came back after years of waiting. When it comes to sex, this is a combination that could point to a lack of sexual activity, even though both of these signs find sex extremely important in their lives. To begin with, they might feel no attraction at all, and even start a relationship on a basis formed in friendship, only to realize that there is no chemistry between them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf lack of attraction doesn’t stop them, usually something else will. It is a combination that gives in to outer circumstances and things that are out of their control. Both of them could feel pressured and their self-esteem could suffer greatly. Still, there is an understanding between them ignited by Saturn’s exaltation in Libra. This makes them both understand good timing and usually won’t allow them to make a mistake expecting what should not be expected. In case they overcome all of the obstacles and form a strong bond through their personal natal positions, Libra and Capricorn can have sexual relations that are pretty conservative, routinely approached, and only satisfying if they both let go of their strict premises and conditions."},"Trust":{"Value":80,"Description":"A strange thing in a relationship of Libra and Capricorn is a really high level of trust between them. Even though Libra can sometimes have questionable motives, a Capricorn partner will make them turn to Saturn completely and feel guilty at the smallest glimpse of a possible lie. The only possible problem surfaces when Capricorn is too strict from the start, making their Libra partner feel inadequate, judged, or even scared of the consequences of their actions. This could make their relationship dishonest, not because there is actually something to hide, but because Libra partner feels the need to protect themselves by holding on to their privacy."},"Intellect":{"Value":35,"Description":"We wouldn’t say that Libra is that stubborn, but when they find themselves in a relationship with a Capricorn, they suddenly become headstrong and sometimes even impossible to talk to. Even though Libra loves Capricorn because of Saturn’s exaltation, this is shown in the most unusual way, for they seem to feel the need to speak out of spite. This can be a long battle, with no winners or losers, simply two people always building walls between each other, for reasons that aren’t clear to anyone around them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe biggest obstacles to their understanding are the elements they belong to. Air and Earth are too far apart and it seems unclear to these partners how to reach each other on any issue in life. Still, there is a prudence to both of them that might give them just enough depth and understanding to have very interesting discussions and motivate each other to build a better foundation for every next debate. If they remain rational in their mental relations, they could have a lot of fun that other signs wouldn’t be able to understand.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe satisfaction they will both get from serious problem solving might lead them to a point where they find a solution together, Libra puts it in words and Capricorn puts it in action. There is probably nothing in the world that could raise their egos higher than situations in which they managed to resolve something by a simple shared effort.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Emotions":{"Value":1,"Description":"The hardest thing to reconcile in the relationship between a Libra and a Capricorn, are the ways they approach their feelings. Libra is a sign ruled by Venus and their emotions come naturally, but usually restricted and held back due to the seriousness of their nature and the judgment of others they fear. Capricorn has a mission in life to accept all emotion, and in most cases, unless enlightened, they will be this judgmental force that holds Libra down. As if this wasn’t enough, the entire situation will feed Capricorn’s ego and make them think they are right about their approach, leading them further away from their focus point.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a couple that has to work hard on finding a shared language to show how they feel and still respect each other. The emotional nature of Capricorn makes them distant for many, but completely untouchable for Libra as soon as they start dismissing their feelings. The only thing that can be done here is find a point of absolute respect and acceptance of all emotions and their manifestations. If they allow each other to break things, get angry, cry, make scenes in public or give in to hysteria, they might find a way to express their love in a way that will be correctly understood.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Values":{"Value":50,"Description":"The most important values Libra and Capricorn share are the value of time and taking responsibility. This can help them overcome any differences and opposing attitudes, values or convictions, for each of these partners will be ready to understand the set of responsibilities they have toward each other. As Air and Earth signs, both pretty set in their ways, Libra and Capricorn will differ greatly in the value of words and deeds. Libra will communicate and think that their mind is their biggest asset, while Capricorn won’t really care if results aren’t manifested through the material world. This is a good training for a Libra partner to find grounding, but it usually won’t be pleasant for any of them in a romantic relationship."},"Activities":{"Value":25,"Description":"The best thing these two can do together is be boring to the rest of the world. There is a great chance they will be lulled by their relationship to the state of hard work and lazy rest, with no effort for anything creative or inspiring.

This doesn’t mean they won’t enjoy the trouble of being together, or stay in a relationship for a very long time, but this is most certainly not a bond that many other signs would engage in. Their biggest challenge is the lack of respect for emotional value that is usually initiated by Capricorn, but easily continued by Libra. If they find a way to share, show and understand each other’s emotions, everything else will seem like a piece of cake."}},"Aquarius":{"Love":{"Value":90,"Description":"Aquarius can truly help Libra express their sexuality. The problems with Libra’s Sun bring too much concern for opinions of other people, so representatives of this sing go to extremes when it comes to the way they show their sexuality. They will either be afraid to be judged and seem too asexual, or have a need to show it “in spite” of everyone’s opinion and this can be quite repulsive for their partner. When it comes to sexuality, Aquarius has an entirely different approach – they simply don’t care about anyone’s opinion. They live their life in a constant search for freedom from any taboos or restrictions, and this will help Libra forget about other people, at least for some time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough their sex life can be quite liberating for Libra, it can also be a bit challenging for Aquarius because they will be the one who has to fight against Libra’s need to fit in. However, as two Air signs, they will both tend to be free to express their sexual desires to each other. They will like to experiment, learn about each other and their own inner desires and communicate with ease. Their sexual relations should be a strong pillar of their entire relationship, although they will usually think of their verbal ways to get along as the most important for their bond.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Trust":{"Value":85,"Description":"Because of their righteous natures they could trust each other without exception, if they were only that sure of themselves. Their insecurities coincide very well, and they will usually help one another move through them, but the trust between them needs to be built, it is not implied. Both of these signs like to be attractive to different people and they should find a way to communicate this need in the right way. The problem can arise when Libra starts to get attached and becomes emotionally dependent on their partner. This is not something Aquarius will easily deal with and it could damage the trust of both partners, in each other and their entire relationship."},"Intellect":{"Value":40,"Description":"Libra and Aquarius both have certain images to maintain. Libra wants to look nice and act nice for others, while Aquarius wants to go in the opposite direction of everyone, sometimes even if there is no reason to do so. They are both stiff in their convictions and won’t easily change their mind once they are set on it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAquarius won’t have such a good time waiting for Libra to make any decision in their life, no more than Libra will enjoy the spontaneous, unpredictable nature of Aquarius. Since they both rely on communication, they will have a lot to talk about and will usually find a language to solve all of their issues. Still, it won’t be easy for them to reconcile some of the differences in their approach to things. Libra is indecisive but once they make a decision, they will rather stick to it than salvage their relationship, even if it is a simple meal in question. Aquarius will have a tendency to walk away as soon as they feel pressured into anything, even if it is that same meal. So basically, they could have an enormous problem about lunch if we talk about extremes.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, they usually understand each other well on usual, daily things and have similar convictions that help them handle big changes in life well. In time, as they get to know each other, their personalities will get along better and they could realize that they respect each other to a point that is unreachable with anybody else."},"Emotions":{"Value":80,"Description":"Libra is a sign ruled by Venus and this makes them emotional in a way, but we should remember that it is also a sign of Saturn’s exaltation and detachment is something that makes them feel very good. This is something they will get in a relationship with Aquarius and it could help them both build a very strong emotional bond. They have strangely different goals in life, but if they harmonize them, their emotional bond should be very strong and develop much faster than we would anticipate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe biggest obstacle that could present in their way is marriage, at some point in their relationship. Libra is a sign that represents marriage and finds it very meaningful as the institution Saturn would support. Aquarius might think of it as obsolete, even run from it and they will probably enter it only for practical reasons. It is important not to make pressure to any of the partners when this point in their relationship arises, or they might both feel repulsed and angry, leading to unnecessary conflicts and even the end of their relationship."},"Values":{"Value":50,"Description":"As much as Libra will value togetherness, Aquarius will value solitude. This could represent a big problem in their relationship, and Libra partner could seem clingy and not at all independent, while Aquarius might seem like an uncontrollable lunatic who would do anything to destroy all relationships in the world. Still, they both value communication and intellectual strengths enough to talk about their needs and desires, and this should help them overcome their differences."},"Activities":{"Value":65,"Description":"Aquarius will want to do anything, really, for as long as their life doesn’t fall into a boring routine. Libra will have trouble deciding what they want to do and this could drive their partner crazy. If something can launch Aquarius into the orbit it’s the lack of spontaneity and Libra can sometimes be the opposite of spontaneous. These partners could end up in a relationship in which only Aquarius pulls the strings and Libra follows. This wouldn’t really be a good solution for any of the partners, and Aquarius will have to learn to show some patience in order for respect between them to remain intact."},"Summary":{"Value":68,"Description":"There is a strong understanding between a Libra and an Aquarius partner due to their shared element of Air. Still, it can be quite difficult for their troubled Suns to get along and they will often have difficulty adjusting to each other’s character and finding deep respect for one another. The best cure for any problem in their relationship is usually in time, but with Aquarius’ need for spontaneity they often won’t last long enough for time to mend what gets broken. Whatever their story, they will have a lot of exciting things to live through together and if they fall in love, it would be a shame for a couple such as this one, not to give their relationship a try however it might end."}},"Pisces":{"Love":{"Value":50,"Description":"Air and Water, Libra and Pisces seem to have almost nothing in common. However, we shouldn’t forget their connection through Venus, the ruler of Libra, exalted in Pisces. Since they touch each other through this sensual, loving planet, they might find true sexual satisfaction together. They can both be selfless lovers, caring more about the satisfaction of their partner than their own.\\r\\n\\r\\nTenderness shouldn’t be an issue here for none of these partners will like too much aggression and roughness anyway. They could discover many different sexual preferences that they weren’t aware of before, through a connection of very different natures. If they weren’t connected by Venus, it would be very difficult for them to form a relationship on any kind, for their approach to life and sexuality is completely different.\\r\\n\\r\\nLibra partner wants someone strong, passionate and confident, while Pisces partner wants someone gentle, compassionate and aware of their feelings. Libra will want their sexual experiences fast and exciting, and Pisces will want them slow and sensual. The main issue of speed is usually overcome by the quickly changeable nature of Pisces, except in cases when they are too shy to jump into a sexual relation with someone as openly sexual as Libra."},"Trust":{"Value":1,"Description":"They will not understand each other well enough to share much trust. The need Libra has to be accepted and liked by other people will be wrongly interpreted by Pisces, for they don’t understand how can someone’s self-confidence be that low. That sparkly, always in love, childish, flirty nature of Pisces will be a huge turn off for Libra, who will not be able to trust someone who openly shows their interest in other people. The only way for these partners to remain in a trusting relationship is to approach it casually and build their understanding and trust from zero, as if they have never had any relationships prior to this one.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Intellect":{"Value":5,"Description":"In many cases, Libra will cherish the optimism and the childish naïve nature of their Pisces partner. Unfortunately, they will often want to help them grow and change who they are so they could be “happier”. The problem here is in the fact that Libra doesn’t know or try to understand what would make Pisces truly happy. This is some basic disrespect and it could ruin the foundation of their entire relationship. The main challenge here is to remain in a respectful bond, however crazy Pisces might seem to their Libra partner, or however stiff and boring Libra might seem to Pisces.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir communication can be inspiring for as long as they don’t try to change each other, explain to each other how they should think or feel in certain situations, or even worse, teach each other how to behave. Pisces partner can be quite direct and spontaneous and this might endanger the image Libra is trying to maintain in the eyes of others. If they find each other’s actions inspiring in any possible way, they might reach a point in which they will truly communicate without judgment.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Emotions":{"Value":15,"Description":"Their emotional connection is mostly presented through the adoration of Venus in the sign of Pisces. This is an everlasting love waiting to happen, and the kind that could be born between these partners in case they both overcome their ego. It will be a rare occurrence and their rationalities will weigh them down, for Libra does exalt Saturn, and Pisces are ruled by Jupiter. Their minds will probably be filled with all sorts of irrelevant information until they decide that it is simply too hard for them to be together.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they pass the point of disrespect and set strong boundaries, nurturing each other’s individuality and self-sufficiency, they might reach the point of emotional interaction. As if they didn’t have enough challenges, this will usually happen at a different time. Libra will rush into an emotional showoff, realizing that they have found love, but Pisces will not feel any love until all the dust settles and they have the time to close their eyes and feel. If their timing is off, they will probably end their relationship on good terms, not expecting much from each other in the future.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Values":{"Value":60,"Description":"They will both value love and this is something that will connect them over everything else. With Venus at focus, they will both need to be loved and cherish those who know how to show it, hot to enjoy life, food and sex, and how to make their loved ones satisfied. This could give them a strong foundation for a sexual relationship if they are attracted to each other in the first place. The rest of their characters will differ greatly and while Libra will value consistency and stability, Pisces will value spontaneity and one’s ability to follow their heart. If they both believe that they have a mission here on Earth, and it happens that their missions cross paths, they could inspire each other to fight for what they value most – their names in the stars.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Activities":{"Value":40,"Description":"Indecisive Libra is exactly what their Pisces partner doesn’t need in order not to feel completely lost in life and all of their chosen activities. The problem here is that by the time Libra decides if they want to do something or not, Pisces will change their minds five times, not sure if this is the best thing for them, for their relationship, for their life’s purpose and mission, etc. The questioning of Libra will raise suspicions in Pisces with painful ease. They will manage to find activities they will both like, and if nothing else works they can always turn to any sort of art. The real question is – will they want to do anything while they are together? They could drain so much strength and confidence out of each other just trying to make a plan for the night."},"Summary":{"Value":29,"Description":"Libra and Pisces have a meeting point in the beauty of Venus. Still, they perceive it in two different ways and they will often not respect each other enough to find the beauty of Venus in one another. They could have real trouble adjusting to their partner’s speed, and the mutable quality of Pisces often won’t help them open up any faster to build a relationship in the pace that would fit their Libra partner. Both Libra and Pisces can selflessly be interested in the satisfaction of their partner, and this should help them stay on the good side of their relationship whatever happens between them. If they move past the disrespect and the unrealistic expectations from each other’s personalities, they might find that they share real love.\\r\\n\\r\\n"}}},"Scorpio":{"Aries":{"Love":{"Value":50,"Description":"Aries and Scorpio are signs with an unbreakable bond. Aries is our first breath, Scorpio is the last. They are two sides of the same coin, both ruled by Mars, a planet of instincts, necessities of the body and sexuality as one of these. When they are in a sexual relationship, it can be difficult to set all of the aggression aside. Not only are they both ruled by Mars, but Scorpio is ruled by Pluto, too. Pluto is known for its destructive qualities, usually related to sexual repression and it can intensify all things, sex primarily. So they are basically a combination of everything we don’t want to deal with when it comes to sex, taboos and instinctive sexual behavior.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a contact that lacks pleasures and tenderness of Venus. Both signs are the opposite of ones ruled by Venus and represent positions where Venus is in detriment. We could say that this means “lack of love”, but it is not quite that simple. Since Scorpio is a Water sign, it is connected to our deepest, darkest ability to love. Scorpios need to feel emotion in their sexual experiences, but due to suppressive nature of our society, can live out some weird sexual scenarios that may seem “sick and twisted” to more conservative zodiac signs. It is a good thing that Aries rarely belongs to this category, for it is a sign where all conservative and rigid opinions have fallen with Saturn.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Aries and Scorpio find an understanding inside their sexual relationship, they will probably become the atomic bomb of all sexual experiences you can think of. Still, it is hard for them to find their shared language. They are, in fact, completely different. Aries likes things “straight” and simple. Scorpio, on the other hand, has a slight need to manipulate, play a game of seduction and takes sexual relations very seriously. They always want to transcend all of their previous sexual experiences and find someone they can merge their Soul with, to possess and adore until they die. Aries is much more simple and masculine when it comes to sex. It is a physical need that needs to be met. They usually have to build emotion inside a sexual relationship as they get to know their partner. This relationship’s real possibility exists only if they share the need to satisfy one another and treat each other with enough tenderness."},"Trust":{"Value":90,"Description":"As opposed to sexual compatibility, this issue is easy for them. “If you lie, you die.” Not literally, of course, but a small lie could easily end their relationship. They are both jealous and possessive by nature. Aries likes to win and be the best lover and partner anyone has ever had. Scorpio wants to be the only one that was ever loved by their Aries partner. If they have doubts about each other’s actions, it is very likely they won’t last very long."},"Intellect":{"Value":20,"Description":"Aries will probably tap their foot impatiently while Scorpio goes on and on about all those deep and meaningful things. From the perspective of Aries, this is something nobody should think about, let alone talk about all of the time. This wouldn’t be expressed as boredom (although this is always an option with Aries), but more as a need to act and stop obsessing about everything. Scorpio is too dark and difficult for Aries, as much as Aries is too shallow from Scorpio’s perspective. What they both enjoy though is their shared ability to give a lot of information in only a sentence or two, but this could interfere with their communication even more, since they might say everything they need to in a couple of minutes and have nothing to talk about afterwards."},"Emotions":{"Value":1,"Description":"It is really easy for Scorpio to get hurt here. It seems like they jumped into this relationship only for this reason, so they can repay some sort of a karmic debt. Aries will probably never know or understand what happened in Scorpio’s emotional world because they simply didn’t sense anything.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey don’t have a strong affection to emotion in general and they are both trying hard to be strong and unemotional. This is due to the archetypal “battle” of Mars with the Moon – the rejection of one’s emotional Self and too much roughness in order to survive. Since there is no one here to keep the emotional balance between them, it will be very easy for them to openly “cut” one another, possibly many times, before one of them decides to cut their bond entirely."},"Values":{"Value":40,"Description":"It is a good thing they both value bravery and things that are concrete and clear. Still, they part ways in their further processing of these.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Aries considers something is done with as soon as it’s cleared, Scorpio will dig for reasons why it would be unclear, or was unclear in the first place. So when together, they would both feel the need to clear things up, but Scorpio will obsess about them even when issues are solved and find new details that need to be cleared up, again and again. They need to be productive and fully independent, or they will drive their Aries partner crazy.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it comes to bravery, Aries thinks of bravery as a knight’s tale, something to show when you are wearing your sword, while Scorpio thinks it is brave to sink into the darkness of the mind, go to the underground, the underworld or challenge the devil himself. This is exactly where the difference in their deep levels of the nature of Mars comes to light. Although everything seems the same, nothing is even remotely close to being similar at all, as soon as you scratch beneath the surface."},"Activities":{"Value":99,"Description":"You could say that their main shared activity is sex. Everything else is secondary anyway."},"Summary":{"Value":48,"Description":"Think of this combination of signs through the most aggressive image of Fire and Water element. Fire evaporates Water, just like Aries shatters Scorpio’s feelings. Water damps down Fire, just like Scorpio wears Aries out. They seem to bring out the worst in each other and this is nobody’s fault, it is just hard to reconcile so much focused energy that moves in two different directions. Their relationship is like the process of nuclear fusion and often just too much to handle.\\r\\n\\r\\n"}},"Taurus":{"Love":{"Value":95,"Description":"As all opposing signs, Taurus and Scorpio can be madly attracted to each other, more so because of the sexual nature of their signs. We wouldn’t primarily link Taurus to sexuality, but it does represent sensuality and is a sign that governs physical pleasure. Their relationship is a connection of deepest emotions and sexuality that no other couple in the zodiac is privileged to have.\\r\\n\\r\\nAny sort of sexual frustration could lead to a pretty dark approach to their sex life. Scorpio has this depressive need to die naked and sweaty in the arms of a loved one, while Taurus has the need to be loved this much. It may even sound romantic, but carries with it all unsolved emotional issues as baggage into their sexual encounters. This doesn’t mean their sex life will be bad. On the contrary, they will both find it fantastic, because they will fill it with all sorts of emotions, good or bad. In the end, emotion will be the only thing that is left and sex will be a way to connect rather than a means to personal satisfaction. This can become an obsession and even an addiction, but who would give up on the opportunity of such deep intimacy?\\r\\n\\r\\nAs signs of fixed quality, when they click, it is impossible to separate them, and no one would want to when you consider the possible vengeance of Scorpio. They represent the basic contact between sexual planets Venus and Mars, while being from the physical and emotional realms as an Earth and a Water sign. They are the signification of a deeply intimate relationship and a very rich sex life, for as long as Scorpio is tender enough and Taurus ready to experiment."},"Trust":{"Value":80,"Description":"Scorpio rarely trusts anyone but themselves unconditionally and in a relationship with Taurus they need to build the sense of security. We wouldn’t exactly say that Scorpio is insecure, but their deep emotional nature makes them question everyone’s motives in caution not to get hurt.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a fine line between two possibilities in a relationship of Taurus and Scorpio. The first possibility would be the one in which Taurus partner is really closed up, unreachable and too quiet. This could wake the suspicious nature of Scorpio and their obsessive interrogations will damage their mutual trust even more then they lacked it in the first place. The second option would be for Taurus partner to be open just enough to share what Scorpio needs to hear.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they manage to find this fine balance, they shouldn’t have a problem. As they get more and more intimate, Taurus will feel secure enough to share everything Scorpio wants to know and Scorpio will realize that their stable and unchangeable Taurus won’t disappoint them."},"Intellect":{"Value":75,"Description":"As all opposing signs, they seem completely different and as if they have nothing in common. Still, we should keep in mind that opposing signs complement each other perfectly and their communication should be exciting, challenging and something to enjoy if they are both confident enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Scorpio would go in depth about all those things Taurus doesn’t seem to care about, they could be very surprised to find that behind the tender and alive nature of Taurus, there is a deep understanding of everything natural going on, however dark it might seem. In return, Scorpio will show Taurus the value of life from their perspective. Taurus will find it incredible how Scorpio as a sign of death and destruction, can understand the depth of life and emotion better than any other sign in the zodiac."},"Emotions":{"Value":99,"Description":"This emotional connection is really something to deserve. Not only do these two represent the axis of Moon’s special dignities, exalted in Taurus and fallen in Scorpio, but they also have Venus as a ruler on one hand and the intense element of Water on the other. When they fall in love, they become an image of eternal love. There is no better personification of Had, the god of the underworld in ancient Greece, and Persephone – an idea of immortal love that can never die."},"Values":{"Value":99,"Description":"They value life and love in a way that no other sign understands. The depth of their belief system goes as far as planet Earth’s core and if they begin their relationship on the same page, this could be what binds them for years. Although their perspectives differ when it comes to material and emotional values, their core is the same and everything else can be adjusted."},"Activities":{"Value":85,"Description":"Although Scorpio is a sign of change, this doesn’t mean they are not very slow in their everyday routine. As a fixed sign, they are, as much as Taurus, static and inert. There is a lot of energy to Scorpio, nuclear energy lies within their sign, but when it comes to everyday life, they tend to repeat patterns and blend in what mostly other people find “normal”. They do however need new, exciting and breathtaking experiences from time to time, but they would be ok having them alone if their Taurus partner wasn’t interested.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf all possible activities, they will mostly share sexual ones and all experiences of physical pleasure. They will both enjoy discovering how far their sexual desire could lead and this will keep them busy most of the time.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Summary":{"Value":89,"Description":"Taurus and Scorpio are both signs of deepest physical pleasure, each in their own way. This has to be the focus of their relationship, for they can’t seem to understand platonic and imaginative relationships when they get together. There is no such thing as a platonic experience of romance, when the whole point of romance is to get physical. It is very possible that they will build their sexual life to the point where no other partner could ever satisfy their needs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis could lead to a possessive relationship with no way out, although they probably wouldn’t want to get out even if they could. The entire experience can be too dark for the Taurus partner, especially if their practical sense is challenged by Scorpio’s character. In case they are both independent and ready to blend with someone else, they could be the perfect connection between sexual and emotional, the one that we all wish for."}},"Gemini":{"Love":{"Value":1,"Description":"A sexual relationship between a Gemini and a Scorpio is like a connection of the deepest and the highest point on planet Earth. Gemini is so far off from Scorpio’s emotional world that good sex between them seems like something almost impossible to happen. This couple needs to be supported by other positions in their natal charts if they are to stand any chance of lasting in a loving, sexual relationship.\\r\\n\\r\\nGemini can be superficial and there is no other sign who knows this better, than Scorpio. Their Air element combined with the rule of Mercury and its lack of emotion is close to Scorpio’s worst nightmare. Scorpio is a sign of our deepest emotions and as such, linked to the most intimate side of sexuality. When they begin a relationship with Gemini, it probably never crosses their mind that such an asexual person can exist in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they fall in love with each other, there is so much for both of them to learn. Scorpio gives a strong focus on their sex life and can be very creative when relaxed. Still, they have a tendency to make a dark, sadistic or masochistic atmosphere that Gemini can only laugh at. If their mutual respect is at a very high point, Gemini could teach Scorpio that not everything needs to be so fatalistic in their sex life. In return, Scorpio will give their Gemini partner depth and emotional vibe to sex that they have never encountered before."},"Trust":{"Value":5,"Description":"Scorpio trusts everyone until they don’t. They have this weird, possessive nature that can give ultimate trust to their partner until the first worm of suspicion is created, usually by flakiness and disrespect. They like things clean and without a doubt, and are prepared to give unconditional honesty, expecting the same in return. This is where Gemini comes and asks a simple question – how can I be honest when I don’t know what my truth is in the first place? It is ridiculous to expect such a definite honesty out of a Gemini partner when they are so prone to change and have no idea what they will feel or do tomorrow. Still, they have a knack for communication that can save the day, but it can only be used if Scorpio doesn’t feel threatened because of their previous heartbreak they’ve never healed from."},"Intellect":{"Value":20,"Description":"It is a good thing that Gemini can communicate with anyone. They will be moved and intrigued by Scorpio’s nature, and very curious as usual. This will be amplified by Scorpio’s depth and interesting topics, up to the point where they get too dark and depressive. This is something Gemini doesn’t want to deal with if they don’t have to. Unfortunately, there is not a lot that Scorpio thinks they can learn from Gemini. Although they might wish to be more superficial, when they get in contact with someone with less depth, their ego sparks and they feel dominant because they are just the way they are. They will hardly ever respect Gemini for this, and can try to feed on their personality in order to add quality to their own.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn case they share interests and have similar professional or educational directions, they could complement each other very well. Gemini would give ideas and discover new information, while Scorpio will dig in and give real essence to everything. Their communication can be inspirational if they get into this mode and start accepting each other’s qualities. They have so much to give to each other and it would be a shame if they held their relationship in an ego conflict for too long.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Emotions":{"Value":1,"Description":"Emotional lack of compatibility is what ruins their sex life and gives them both a headache. If one of them falls in love with the other, they will hardly have a good time if their feelings are not returned in the same proportion. We could say it’s hard for them to synchronize, because the emotions Scorpio would give away freely are something Gemini would have to be swept off their feet for. They don’t seem to have the same emotional scale and this can leave them both unsatisfied or pressured to a breaking point. The best option for their shared emotional world would be for both partners to give what they can and not expect anything in return."},"Values":{"Value":20,"Description":"The good thing in their relationship is that they both value strength of thought. Although Scorpio values many other things in someone’s personality, they will be impressed by someone’s intelligence and resourcefulness. Gemini will focus on the same thing, but have a slightly different assessment of someone’s intellect. However, they can agree to have a shared point of same value, although other things they strive for will differ greatly.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Activities":{"Value":40,"Description":"A great thing with these two is their openness for change. Gemini will want to change the scenery and Scorpio will want to change their life, gladly taking Gemini’s small steps toward this goal. Scorpio is a fixed sign, set in change of huge proportions, and Gemini’s mutable quality will annoy them in most cases. Still, they can relate to their need for different experiences in life and the excitement they always search for. Even though they might not be excited by the same things, there will be enough excitement for both partners to choose along the path they decide to cross together."},"Summary":{"Value":15,"Description":"Gemini and Scorpio will usually annoy each other senseless. None of them will lightly understand their partner’s personality. To Gemini, their partner will seem too depressed and dark for no apparent reason, and for Scorpio, this could be an experience with no purpose or depth. If they do fall crazy in love, they could connect through their mutual love of change and give each other the exact things they lack. Gemini would get deep, emotional satisfaction they have never felt before and Scorpio would finally get the chance to rest their troubled soul, and realize that not everything needs to be taken seriously. This is a relationship of great lessons and an enormous capacity for personal growth of both partners.\\r\\n\\r\\n"}},"Cancer":{"Love":{"Value":90,"Description":"The sign of Scorpio is associated with death and all kinds of bad things, but all of their maliciousness comes from their emotional and sexual repression. Cancer can usually understand the need of their Scorpio partner to express their deepest, darkest emotions in their sex life. If Cancer partner doesn’t get scared or too forced to do something they are not ready for, a sexual relationship between Cancer and Scorpio can be deeply satisfying for both partners.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a relationship of two Water signs and because of this their sex life needs to reflect all of their emotional connection or a lack of it if there is any. When they fall in love, they will both need to express their feelings and the intimacy they might share is incredible.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, Scorpio is a sign in which the Moon falls and this is the ruler of the sign of Cancer. If Scorpio’s need to bury their emotions is too intense, there is a great chance they will be too rough or insensitive on their partner. This is something Cancer will have difficulty coping with and could lead to Cancer’s need to separate because they could simply get tired from all the special or aggressive sexual requirements their Scorpio partner has."},"Trust":{"Value":95,"Description":"When Scorpio falls in love, trust is one of the most important things they are looking for. If they feel betrayed in any way, they can start showing all of those maleficent sides of their nature and become truly possessive and jealous. Cancer partner usually wants someone to share a life with and they will have no reason to cheat or lie to their partner.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs all water signs, they could both fear telling the truth to a certain point, but this doesn’t necessarily need to speak of their unfaithfulness or the beginning of the end of their relationship. Usually they will both be able to give each other enough security to feel safe and build the trust they both need not to feel hurt or betrayed.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Intellect":{"Value":99,"Description":"Cancer and Scorpio usually understand each other without words. This can influence their sex life and make it much better, or much worse, depending on how their need for mystery is expressed. Their communication is very good, for as long as emotions are not the main theme of a conversation. They can finish each other’s sentences if they have any need to talk in the first place. The depth they both have, although it might not be visible at first in Cancer partner, makes them able to talk about anything at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the case when Cancer wants to run from negative experiences and Scorpio from their emotions, they could have trouble forming a relationship at all. Still, this is a very rare scenario and even if they have these tendencies, they will probably help each other deal with them and give each other the exact mental stimulation they both need.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Emotions":{"Value":70,"Description":"This is a tricky territory for a couple like this one. Cancer lives buried in their emotions, positive or negative, capable of using them in their everyday routine as an incorporated part of their life. Scorpio can have trouble understanding how this works exactly, because they have a tendency to dismiss emotions, thinking that this is the only way to reach a certain goal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe middle ground they need to find is a place where they are both free to follow these needs. Emotions have to be a way of living, as much as they can interfere with our goals. Both of these partners need to learn to lose control, as well as gain it again, in order to be able to let things flow and change in the way they are supposed to."},"Values":{"Value":25,"Description":"Cancer values their inner peace and wants a stable life with a family they can rely on. Scorpio represents change and values it most of all, even if they are not fully aware of this. It can be difficult for these partners to coordinate their personalities if they are both not flexible enough to understand their differences and the depth each of them has behind these superficial needs. Scorpio can fear emotion to the point of agony and if Cancer recognizes this, they will be able to approach them in the best way possible and discover their true need for security and emotional balance.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Activities":{"Value":95,"Description":"It doesn’t really matter what Cancer and Scorpio will do if they both feel good with each other. They have to share emotions and protect their loved ones – Cancer due to their motherly need to protect people they love, and Scorpio in order to set good boundaries on what they think is right. If they create their own little world, they can be found in any situation together, dealing with things as one being. Scorpio usually likes some dangerous activities and Cancer will have difficulty adjusting to those, but if their emotional core is good, they will have a quiet understanding of each other’s needs, however destructive they might get."},"Summary":{"Value":79,"Description":"A relationship between a Cancer and a Scorpio can go from one extreme to another, and although Cancer partner will try hard to stabilize it, it might be too difficult if Scorpio doesn’t have enough respect for their own emotions. When they find an emotional link, they can go very deep in search of true love, and unite on a level that is unreachable for other zodiac signs. This can make them speak without words, understand each other’s thoughts with only one shared glance and be synchronized in their approach to their future together.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf their emotions aren’t shared on a deepest possible level, or Scorpio partner refuses to deal with them, it could be too hard for Cancer to handle the self-destructive nature of their partner. Their connection needs to be sincere and pure, in order for both of them to be ready to give in to this intense emotional contact."}},"Leo":{"Love":{"Value":5,"Description":"This is a complicated relationship between two strong personalities with an incredible sex drive. Leo is a passionate lover, warm, always in search for action and they can be quite casual when it comes to their sexual encounters. Scorpio is sex itself, and the depth of emotion that goes with it in its purest form. When they get together, they could have real trouble finding middle ground between their personalities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese partners can seem as if they’ve crashed into each other with no plan or purpose. If they are attracted to each other, this could drive them mad, for none of them will be able to realize their desires in a wanted way. If they end up having sexual relations, they could have misunderstandings on everything, from their verbal communication to their physical needs. They simply don’t operate in the same ways and while Leo wants to be respected, Scorpio understands that all respect dies in the act of sex.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is extremely difficult for a Leo and a Scorpio to reach intimacy, because they have a different view on emotions. What Leo sees as love, Scorpio finds superficial and irritating, and what Scorpio sees as love, Leo finds depressing and irritating. They both need to give up control entirely if they want to find sexual satisfaction with each other.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Trust":{"Value":65,"Description":"The positive side to this relationship when it comes to trust is in the fixed quality of both signs. This is not such a good thing when it comes to their ability to adapt and be flexible for each other, but it is a perfect thing for mutual trust. If they set the clear foundation in the beginning of their relationship, Leo transparent as they are and Scorpio direct and honest, they might trust each other without exception for a very long time. That is if they both want to be open for this kind of relationship in the first place.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Intellect":{"Value":30,"Description":"It is a good thing that these two signs can be so well behaved. Although this is not always the case, Leo wants to show the right image to the world, and Scorpio understands karma better than many other signs. This is why they will probably have enough respect for each other to communicate in a civilized manner. They are both obsessive in a way. Leo will never give up on chasing their passion, with enough energy to spark everyone around them, and Scorpio will hold on to things they care about, and obsessively fight for their goals. If they share the same passion or interests, they will have something to talk about, obsessively.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe depth that is typical for Scorpio is something that Leo tries hard to reach in their search for Unity. Their conversations can be very tense and irritating for both, but along the way they might realize that they give each other exactly what they both need."},"Emotions":{"Value":1,"Description":"This is probably the most challenging relationship in the entire zodiac when it comes to emotions that these partners have for each other. In some cases, they can be identified with hate, but the important thing to remember here is that hate is also love, in its “negative” form, and both of these partners will think that any emotion is better than no emotion. Their a bit torturous relationship can hold them together for a long time, even though they might be unhappy and aware that they could be happier with someone else. In a way, Scorpio likes to be tied through negative emotions, for love sometimes has to hurt, and Leo sticks with their decisions because they rarely accept that they might have been wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis relationship can become a very difficult circle of suffering for both partners, especially if any one of them doesn’t have their independent life, friends and finances. When they do, they might find a fine balance, for as long as they both have freedom to think that there might be better options for them with other people. If they don’t find any, they could realize that they are perfect for each other as self-sufficient individuals, through a healthy approach."},"Values":{"Value":35,"Description":"Both of these partners will value honesty and clarity. Although they understand clarity in different directions and depth, the main characteristics in people they wish to date are very similar. Often, they won’t even recognize their similarity out of an emotionally unstable or obsessively stable position, completely different from a passionate, creative one. They have to deal with the value of creation against the value of destruction and this is not easily reconciled. The bridge between them is found in unconditional honesty."},"Activities":{"Value":40,"Description":"It is very interesting how a Leo and a Scorpio might organize their time together. While they are in most cases interested in different things, Scorpio is ruled by Mars, a planet that Leo understands well and cooperates well with. They will both have the energy to follow each other’s desires and they could actually have a lot of fun. Still, they usually stumble upon a problem when it comes to their understanding of certain circumstances and people around them. There is rarely a compromise between the positive, constructive approach of Leo and the often negative, sensitive approach of Scorpio, especially when none of them is exactly true. It would be best for them to remain true to themselves, and understand that there is a middle ground between their opinions and feelings, however strange it might seem."},"Summary":{"Value":29,"Description":"When Leo and Scorpio start dating, they might not know exactly what they are to expect. This is in no way an easy relationship, and both partners can be stubborn and stiff in their opinions, life choices and ways they handle reality. If they want to remain in a loving relationship, they need to understand each other’s way of expressing emotions and respect each other’s needs however different they might be from those they are used to. When they find a way to love each other without conditioning, they might realize that they are in search for the same thing – Unity."}},"Virgo":{"Love":{"Value":65,"Description":"If there is something Scorpio would like to fight for, it is the chastity of Virgo. This is a very interesting couple in the domain of sexual activity – one of them hiding their sexuality, and the other acting as sex itself. Even though Scorpio can be too rough of Virgo, making them feel uncomfortable and even violated in a way, in most relationships between representatives of these two signs, there is enough rationality to the approach of Virgo to make this contact possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat we often fail to understand is the fact that Scorpio is a Water sign and as such – deeply emotional. Virgo looks for someone emotional to share a life with, and if they share this emotion of Scorpio through their sexual relations, they will both find sex between them extremely satisfying. The best time for Virgo and Scorpio to create enough safety and emotion in their sexual encounters, is in the situation where they are each other’s first truly emotional experience. If they surprise each other with the power of emotions beneath the surface, that both of them seem to carry around, they will have a hard time ever separating from one another.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe biggest problem of these partners is in their relation to Venus, and this can lead to loveless acts of sex that both partners are not truly satisfied with. They need to show love and be tender enough, enjoying themselves enough, or they might have to move on to someone they love more."},"Trust":{"Value":90,"Description":"Trust is a very challenging issue for both of these signs and this is something they can finally talk about with each other. There is a strong understanding here, for one of them fears betrayal more than anything, while the other hates it and gets vindictive as soon as any sign of dishonesty is in sight. The best thing about their connection is in their ability to understand each other in silence, not ever wanting to let each other down."},"Intellect":{"Value":99,"Description":"Virgo is a talkative sign, ruled by Mercury the planet of communication, but they hold on to a much more quiet and intellectual side of Mercury than we might anticipate. Scorpio represents a deep silence of the flow of a river, and they will both have a strong urge to jump into the depths of silence together. Their intellectual contact is stimulating, often strongly influencing their sex life and their truly deep emotions. It is almost as if they wouldn’t be able to form a relationship without this ability for non-verbal communication that makes them perfect for each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth of these signs are prepared to go all the way - Virgo in their intellectual depth and Scorpio in everything in life. This will inspire both of them to search for all sorts of answers together, analyzing each other’s psyche and determining the source of their problems with the world, or with each other. Through carefully chosen words, they can help each other heal or regenerate from difficult or even devastating experiences. It is a good thing for both of these signs to have each other in the time of need."},"Emotions":{"Value":75,"Description":"If someone can reach the emotions hidden behind the extremely rational approach of Virgo, it is Scorpio. We could say that this ability hides in both of them and the dig up goes both ways. The problem here is in the fact that they remind each other of their imperfections. Scorpio is a sign in which the Moon falls and at the same time the sign of Venus’ detriment. All emotions get lost here, as if Scorpio is a black hole that cannot get enough. Virgo partner is already sensitive and when in love, does everything they can to satisfy their Scorpio partner. This can feel like investing into a black hole with no gratitude whatsoever.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, there is no other sign that can sense the needs of Scorpio better than Virgo, and no other sign that can dig up the emotions in Virgo better than Scorpio. An emotional relationship between them can turn out to be truly dark and difficult, but also incredibly strong and intimate. The only thing that can bore their emotions to death is the criticism they are both prone to."},"Values":{"Value":70,"Description":"Both of these partners will value depth, intellectual most of all. There is nothing in the world that is as exciting as conversations that are so intense and so challenging for their minds. Most of the time they will agree on things they value most, although they might stumble upon a huge problem when they get to the point of throwing out the trash. Even though Scorpio doesn’t normally accumulate things, and loves throwing them away, those they hold on to can be quite disgusting to a Virgo. Just imagine as their first child is born and Scorpio wants to frame that dried out residue of an umbilical cord. Do you think Virgo would want to wake up to this in their apartment every morning?"},"Activities":{"Value":55,"Description":"For the same reason their values might differ, their daily routine might differ too. Virgo will clean, that’s a fact, simply because a clean house creates a clear mind, and Scorpio won’t have much trouble fitting in, unless their personal belongings are questioned. However, when they choose places they want to visit, or clubs they want to go to, their choices will differ greatly. It is not hard for them to compromise to keep the relationship going, but it can be quite dark and demanding for both partners. If they don’t start willingly hanging out in some tidy cemeteries, they might run out of options that would actually keep them both interested and happy."},"Summary":{"Value":76,"Description":"That changeable nature of Virgo will be settled down by the fixed quality of their Scorpio partner, who will keep their relationship exciting for a very long time. In general, there is a problem that these partners share when it comes to Venus, and their relationship is often a reflection of these troubles. This can lead to all sorts of emotional blackmail, their tendency to control each other’s lives, and if not this, than constant criticism that makes them both feel guilty or simply sad. The best thing they can do is decide that they will value each other and be thankful for each other in this relationship. If they develop a strong sense of gratitude, their relationship might be extremely deep, exciting and truly appreciated by both partners.\\r\\n\\r\\n"}},"Libra":{"Love":{"Value":45,"Description":"This is an intense couple in every way and their sexual relationship is something truly exciting and challenging at the same time. They are linked through their animalistic natures, continuing one another, ruled by planets that also rule their opposing signs. This is a complicated sexual contact, for they are ruled by Venus and Mars, as if they were made for each other. However, they seem to lack the touch of the element they both need, separated by the quick, superficial element of Air in Libra and emotional, slow element of Water in Scorpio.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven if they don’t make each other happy in other parts of their relationship, when a Libra partner lets go to their instinctive, animalistic side, they easily become one with their Scorpio partner. Their sex life can be incredibly emotional and demanding, for the pull of their energies is extremely strong and makes them both obsessive and possessive to one another. They will both often get so tied that their relationship seems impossible to break. These ties are created through their physical contact, even if everything else in their relationship makes them deeply unsatisfied."},"Trust":{"Value":1,"Description":"If Scorpio cannot trust someone, it is Libra. How could they when there seems to be an obvious need in their Libra partner to show how attractive and sensual they are to the rest of the world. As if this wasn’t enough, that possessiveness of Scorpio is easily absorbed by Libra, and they will start acting in a similar way, obsessing about each time their partner wants to do anything alone. Even though this is the worst case scenario, this atmosphere will probably be present in any Libra Scorpio couple on a smaller scale. The question is – are they ready to live like this every day? If they accept this as a way of sharing true, deep love, than their trust issues might not be much of a problem however weird they might seem."},"Intellect":{"Value":55,"Description":"There is nothing Scorpio can say that Libra won’t be able to rationalize. Their communication is the exact place where the connection of Libra to Saturn comes in handy. This will give Libra the ability to slow down, breathe in, and understand the impulsive acts or words of their Scorpio partner. There is just enough depth in both of these signs, even though Libra is an Air sign and quite distant from planet Earth. This will allow just enough understanding between them in a rational sense.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem they have to deal with is in the fact that they both represent a detriment for each other’s rulers. This will easily lead to the dismissal of each other’s personalities, especially since Libra has to deal with personality issues through the fall of the Sun, and Scorpio doesn’t accept anything that isn’t whole. Libra will have trouble understanding the aggressively clear side of Scorpio, as much as Scorpio won’t understand the dishonest act of their Libra partner. Their differences could be very difficult to reconcile if they get too close to each other and start meddling in their personal lives and decisions.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Emotions":{"Value":25,"Description":"There is an incredible intensity to their feelings when they do fall in love. In many cases, love simply won’t happen. Libra looks for an active, fiery partner that will awaken their life force and bring light into their life. Scorpio looks for someone physical, sensual and practical, and although Libra can meet these needs to some point due to Saturn’s exaltation and the rule of Venus, in most cases this is not primarily who they want to be.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a spark exists between them, it will easily build up to a fire, burning entire cities, forests and everyone on its way including both of them. That nuclear energy of Scorpio is ignited by its preceding sign of Libra, because it carries information on all unresolved issues in relationships and all of the anger that hasn’t been let out because of the forced need for appropriate behavior.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn other words, Libra will accumulate the unexpressed sexual energy and it will burst in Scorpio, leading to a lifelong war if enough is pushed under the rug. This will be construed as ultimate love, making their emotional relationship ridiculously intense. They need to understand that love is about tenderness as much as everything else and if they don’t have any, maybe it is not love but simple physical attraction and a need to vent from restrictions.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Values":{"Value":10,"Description":"Both of these partners will value consistency and commitment and this is something that will connect them in the first place. However, the rest of their systems of value don’t coincide that much and they will differ on behavior and expectations of other people. With Libra frowning at indecent behavior, Scorpio will have indecent friends, honest about their act and fully accepted and respected for that. It seems to Libra that Scorpio does everything out of the ordinary just to seem special, while Scorpio sees Libra as doing everything ordinary just to fit in. The main problem here is in the value they give to opinions of other people and this will not be easy to overcome."},"Activities":{"Value":35,"Description":"If there is an activity a Libra and a Scorpio can share all the time, it must be sex. Scorpio will awaken the animalistic side of their Libra partner, and their time together will most certainly be focused on both partners following their instincts. Scorpio is a sign of the exaltation of Uranus and they will lack patience for indecisiveness of Libra. This is why their needs won’t fit very well in other areas of their lives, and they might not be able to meet each other’s expectations. An exception to this rule occurs when Libra turns to the dark side and gives in to the need of Scorpio to take them to the Underworld. No other partner will ignite this need in Scorpio as a Libra partner."},"Summary":{"Value":29,"Description":"The relationship of Libra and Scorpio is in no way easy and light. Both of these partners will have to face their dark sides through this bond, and although this can lead to an incredible and intense sex life, and emotions that no one else can understand, it might lead them both to a depressive hole they won’t easily get out of. The only way for this couple to last in a satisfying and gentle relationship, is for both partners to build a strong individual, independent life, or they will get sucked into the whirlpool of karmic emotions and obsessive, negative expectations."}},"Scorpio":{"Love":{"Value":65,"Description":"Two Scorpio partners can be a dream come true when it comes to sex, as much as they can be each other’s worst nightmare. Their sexual energy and inner tension is something often hard to handle individually, and when they get together, this either multiplies to infinity, or they find an absolute understanding. Usually, we can predict the first option. In general, every Scorpio needs someone to balance them, for they go to extremes of all kinds, and when together, they will rarely have the patience or the tenderness to balance anything, let alone each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir sex life is intense, often amazing, although everything around it seems to be falling apart. They will fight to make up, manipulate obviously to make each other angry, and do things out of spite. When we talk about spicing one’s sex life, we have to understand that these two are spices themselves, and there is rarely anything boring about them. In order for their sexual relationship to work out, both partners need to stick to that inner tenderness and emotional closeness when together, or they might have to end things as if torn apart by nuclear energy. The key here is to slow down, breathe in, and spend time in each other’s cozy arms."},"Trust":{"Value":40,"Description":"What a strange relationship of two possessive, want-to-know-all, striving-for-freedom partners. As much as each Scorpio wants to be involved in their partner’s life, no Scorpio wants to be controlled or let anyone else be involved in their own life. None of them will understand the lack of trust coming from their partner, lifting their ego high, knowing that there is no reason why they would continue sharing anything with the other Scorpio anymore. The problem here is in the fact that neither of them seems to be aware of what they want from their partner and this can turn into a real battle for supremacy. Still, often enough, they will see each other as true and honest, leaving their insecurities aside, trusting each other without too many words."},"Intellect":{"Value":70,"Description":"When emotional baggage is not a part of their everyday communication, the depth both of their minds have will be an incredible stimulus for each conversation they have. No one can understand a Scorpio intellectually as much as another Scorpio. Their topics can easily become dark, not because they both want to talk about depressing things, but because they understand each other in areas other people don’t want to deal with. This is a good way for both of them to discover that they are not alone, and it can be healing for each partner for as long as emotional expectations are not involved.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they work together and compete to advance to the same position or feel like they endanger each other’s status in any way, their contact can become truly unpleasant and turn to arguing, dismissal of anything said, or in one word – disrespect. When they start a battle against each other, it cannot seem to stop, until one of them is beaten “dead” and there is nothing more that can be done for them to get back in the game. If they see each other as adversaries, they will sting each other for victory, meaning they will do whatever it takes to win. If they distance themselves from a situation, they might realize that none of them actually endangers the other. To find mutual understanding, they need to lead separate lives and give each other enough room to do so."},"Emotions":{"Value":55,"Description":"Scorpio is a Water sign and represents all dismissed emotions we don’t want to deal with. This makes representatives of this sign turned to the dark emotional issues and this is something they will both understand in each other. The problem with Scorpio is in its battle with the Moon and the fact that emotions aren’t approved here. This can make them both intolerant for weakness, rough in their approach to one another and too judgmental toward each other’s emotional needs, even though they both actually share the same needs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey will both be faced with emotions they don’t want to deal with, simply because that is their individual role in other people’s lives. This could lead to numerous conflicts, but it could also be the base for incredible personal evolution of each partner, and an opportunity to be with someone who truly understands the depth of their hearts. The best way for them to approach this relationship is through deepest emotional acceptance and the tolerance for incredible difference in character, even though they are, strangely, the same."},"Values":{"Value":90,"Description":"The problem with things they value is in the illusion of value they both share. They will value rationality and emotional maturity, but those are things none of them can actually deliver all the time. They belong to the element of Water and are deeply emotional, while valuing each other’s lack of emotion, shown at the beginning of their relationship. They do value similar things, but they are not entirely rational or realistic in their choices. This makes them susceptible to judging their own reflection in one another."},"Activities":{"Value":75,"Description":"They won’t have a hard time discussing or agreeing on where to go and what to do together, but their choices might not make them happy. Again, this is about the balance they both seek, needing a partner of opposite character and choices. Their contact could lead them to all the dark places, as they play out situations they couldn’t play out with anyone else. Even though they will feel sad and dried out most of the time, as two members of fixed quality, they could hold on to each other for a long time. The more time they spend together, the less energy they might have, for there is a silent, inner battle in both of them that drains it out of their systems.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Summary":{"Value":66,"Description":"Scorpio and Scorpio have this tendency to bring out the worst in each other. Even though they can share the deepest understanding known to the entire zodiac, they can also get too dark and depressed together, sinking into their pool of unresolved emotions. Their emotional understanding is something worth cherishing, if they are both open for their own feelings and accept their own inner needs."}},"Sagittarius":{"Love":{"Value":25,"Description":"There is a strange understanding between these two signs, as if they were one and the same, at least for a little while. The strength of character they share is something that will give them just the right amount of confidence when it comes to sex, and the creativity and openness of Sagittarius will be refreshing for the fixed nature of Scorpio. However, this often doesn’t last very long and in time, in most cases, Scorpio starts thinking of their Sagittarius partner as unreliable and not to be trusted, while Sagittarius sees Scorpio as dark, pushy and too controlling.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to remain in a healthy sexual relationship, both of these partners have to compromise, Scorpio finding a way to give freedom, while Sagittarius finding a way not to run away from the seriousness of their partner. In the best possible contact, Scorpio will give their sex life emotion and true physical intimacy, while Sagittarius will be there to give meaning and shake things up, representing the light at the end of a tunnel. Together, they can build an incredible sexual relationship, for both tend to be uninhibited about locations, positions and situations in which they wish to make love."},"Trust":{"Value":1,"Description":"The biggest problem for a Scorpio and a Sagittarius in a relationship is trust. Scorpio has the need to tie their partner down, even if they have that seemingly liberating view on love. There is nothing a Sagittarius will dread more than someone trying to control their life. If someone can spark the need of Sagittarius to be unfaithful, it is most definitely Scorpio, launching them further and further away by trying to come closer. An additional problem with this couple is in the quality of their signs, Scorpio being fixed and Sagittarius mutable. This makes it almost impossible for them to share a pace, and in order not to disappoint each other, they both might choose to lie. The strangest thing in this relationship is in the fact that these two signs are, without a doubt, the most honest signs of the zodiac. Still, their relationship seems to face them with the other side of their personality, one none of them wants to see.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Intellect":{"Value":80,"Description":"Two such strong individuals give each other exactly what each of them needs when it comes to their mental compatibility. Not only does Scorpio feel lighter, more optimistic about life and everything in it when communicating with a Sagittarius, but the depth they give to Sagittarius’ mind and ways to reach conclusions is impossible for any other sign. Scorpio will face Sagittarius with any superficial or outdated views, while being compassionate enough to know how to do this without hurting them, and being fixed enough not to change their intent somewhere along the way when Sagittarius thinks of running away.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey will enjoy each other’s company for as long as expectations and emotional disagreements are not in focus, for they have an incredible thing to share – their search for truth. The meaning they seek in all things in life, Scorpio going into depth and Sagittarius traveling wide, will connect them through a strong bond that no other combination of signs can form. If they are on a shared mission, they can accomplish incredible things and have real epiphanies together."},"Emotions":{"Value":10,"Description":"They will enjoy each other’s company for as long as expectations and emotional disagreements are not in focus, for they have an incredible thing to share – their search for truth.

If they are on a shared mission, they can accomplish incredible things and have real epiphanies together."},"Values":{"Value":35,"Description":"Since Scorpio is the sign of the exaltation of Uranus, and Sagittarius understands this through its third house, they both value freedom and one’s ability to fight for their beliefs. They can both feel like outcasts and value each other’s decisions to differ from others out of self-respect. Still, in most cases they will easily consider each other invaluable in a way, for they cannot meet the expectations each of them has for his partner’s personality. The only way for them to value each other, is to focus on the positive characteristics and sides of one another and their entire contact."},"Activities":{"Value":30,"Description":"For as long as their communication is inspiring for both partners, they won’t need much to be satisfied by their activities. Sagittarius will want to try anything new and Scorpio’s approach to life is always new from their perspective, while Scorpio will enjoy the first impulse of optimism and fun. It is a good thing that Scorpio exalts Uranus, for this gives them enough love for change and exciting, new things that Sagittarius can bring into their lives. However, the fixed quality of Scorpio will make this exhilaration fade as soon as their relationship becomes routine, in any way. As time passes, there is a great chance for Sagittarius to start feeling pressured, or simply be bored, and this doesn’t give great promise of future."},"Summary":{"Value":30,"Description":"Scorpio and Sagittarius make a pretty great couple, for as long as they feel the first excitement at the start of their relationship. While they don’t know each other well and everything seems new and incredible, Scorpio will see their Sagittarius partner as a ray of light that suddenly makes their life brighter and better, while Sagittarius will see that there is so much to learn and enjoy the depth of their Scorpio partner, followed by emotional attachment. In time, there is a strong chance they will slowly lose interest in one another, especially the mutable sign of Sagittarius for their fixed Scorpio partner. Even though their relationship might end on bad terms, it would be a shame not to give in to it and let it fascinate and exalt both of them for however long."}},"Capricorn":{"Love":{"Value":60,"Description":"Scorpio and Capricorn share a special sexual bond as signs in sextile with each other and due to the fact that Capricorn exalts one of Scorpio’s rulers, Mars. The physical nature of Capricorn will help Scorpio ground their sexual needs with ease. The main problem of this couple is their relationship to the Moon, for they are signs of its fall and detriment. This “agreement” not to be too sensitive and emotional, can take out any real intimacy from their sex life, and make them too cold and distant, even though physically enjoying their relationship. They might even think that this is all they need, but their hearts won’t agree, and other people will show up in their lives that show them how much they actually depend on intimacy.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth of these signs feel a gravitational pull toward their opposing signs, Taurus and Cancer, two of the most emotional signs of the zodiac. This explains their need to build real intimacy. For both of them, physical pleasure has to be achieved through tenderness and emotion, or they won’t truly be satisfied.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general, Scorpio exalts Uranus, and they might be a bit frustrated by the conservative approach of Capricorn. It is a good thing they can wait and slowly build up an atmosphere in which their Capricorn partner will be relaxed enough to try new things and experiment. The excitement of this sexual contact is something Capricorn will have trouble letting go. Scorpio, on the other hand, will enjoy the sense of security and patience they get from their partner, even if they openly express their sexuality."},"Trust":{"Value":90,"Description":"If there is a sign Scorpio can trust, it is the sign of Capricorn. Even though Capricorn representatives don’t have to be that honest at all, their relationship with this direct and honest partner will make them feel like they should be as honest as possible too. Any lack of trust in their relationship is a consequence of the lack of intimacy, for they seem to lack the ability to sense each other deep enough to understand if they do trust one another or not. This can be solved if each partner deals with their own insecurities individually and with an emotional effort to build intimacy.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Intellect":{"Value":70,"Description":"Fixed, unmovable Scorpio, in the state of constant metamorphosis and evolution in the same direction, can be a bite “too big to chew” for their stubborn, earthly, long lasting in everything Capricorn. Their similar pace and the patience Capricorn has, followed by the feel of Scorpio can help their understanding very much, but when they disagree on something, they could end up in a silent fight for years to come.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is nothing light or easy in this interaction, and even though they understand each other’s depth of mind and a certain “what goes around comes around” view on life, they will rarely laugh, dance, and have fun together. They might think that this is not even something they need, but everyone needs to have some fun and smile, or life loses a lot of its meaning. Dark humor might savor their situation, day after day, and if they have the same friends it will be much easier for them to enjoy life together. All friendships Scorpio makes, become long-term with the help of Capricorn when respected enough, and this could help them build a wonderful surrounding full of understanding people who love them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general, they get each other’s need for silence and patiently approach each other until each of them opens up. This can open the door for a respectful communication and intellectual understanding that lasts for a very long time, if they learn to control all the negative convictions that surface when they are together."},"Emotions":{"Value":35,"Description":"The biggest problem in a relationship between a Scorpio and a Capricorn is their emotional contact, simply because they both tend to have emotional problems, dismissing how they feel by dismissing the Moon. When they start their relationship, they will both give the impression of people who stand with their feet firmly on the ground, strong and rough when needed. They will rarely notice that this brings out the expectation to always be the strong person who they were in the beginning, and making them force things on themselves they are not ready for only to avoid showing any weakness. A lot of deep, emotional understanding is needed for them not to be forced to move even further from their life goal to find emotional balance."},"Values":{"Value":30,"Description":"It is truly interesting to watch this couple share values with such a difficult relation to Venus and the term of value itself. Scorpio is the sign of Venus’ detriment and Capricorn brings a lot of guilt into it, so their combination of values is basically founded on feelings of guilt and the sense that nothing is ever good enough.

If they start digging into the past, they might find shared therapy revealing, even if they don’t need it for any obvious reasons. There is a need in them to dig out the truth, whatever it might be, and this will make it easy for them to spend quality time together without much doubt on what they want to do."},"Summary":{"Value":64,"Description":"The relationship of Scorpio and Capricorn can be inspiring for both partners to search for the truth, dig up under their family tree and deal with any unresolved karma and debt.

If they get tied to each other and break up, they could end up hating each other and despising everything they’ve shared in their sex life.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is very difficult for these partners to find a balance of passion, emotion and rational thinking. While Scorpio’s sexuality is hungry, deeply emotional and pervasive, Aquarius wants to be free of any boundaries and emotion, and will have real trouble being with a possessive partner. Their sex life can be like a battle arena, or like a wonderland, depending on the flexibility of both of them and the depth of emotions they share. As two fixed signs, they will most certainly have trouble changing their natures and adjusting to a partner that is too different from them."},"Trust":{"Value":1,"Description":"How on Earth is it possible for two honest and straightforward individuals such as Scorpio and Aquarius to have such a problem to trust each other? The problem here shows its face when they get too close. As soon as Scorpio starts to assume that Aquarius should be tamer and belong to them in a loving relationship, it will result in a forceful rebellion and the counterattack of their partner. Things could really get out of control if any sort of manipulation takes place, and unspoken tendencies might tear them apart in a matter of minutes."},"Intellect":{"Value":50,"Description":"For as long as they don’t give in to their stubborn, unmovable modes, these partners could have great conversations about all strange topics they can imagine. None of them will want to have small talk or discuss their day at work. It is futile from their perspective, and although Scorpio likes to be in control of everything their partner does, it will be refreshing to talk to someone who says unusual things. The biggest quality of their relationship is an incredible connection of depth and width in only one couple. They will both have trouble understanding our society as it is, and have certain similar perspectives on anything out of the ordinary.\\r\\n\\r\\nScorpio exalts Aquarius’ ruler and this is why their relationship is the possibility for both of them to grow. Not only will Scorpio adore the intellectual strength of their partner, but they will also help them understand the way their ideas might be realized through a feeling of ultimate possibility.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe weakest link in their relationship is their respect for each other, combined with their static natures. We would think that both of these signs are in connection to change and they couldn’t possibly be static, but in fact, they are static in their way of change, and their biggest challenge is to stop for a minute and treasure what they’ve found in each other."},"Emotions":{"Value":1,"Description":"If love happens between them, the most typical scenario is for Scorpio to fall into an obsessive mess of feelings towards their uninterested Aquarius partner. It takes a lot of work and commitment to reach the emotional core of Aquarius, and it is impossible to get there without spontaneity and trust. Scorpio can be spontaneous in situations that are free of emotions, but will rarely let their love for someone be a part of a maybe-yes-maybe-no swing controlled by their partner.\\r\\n\\r\\nAquarius will rarely tolerate or be with someone who tries to make them be more stable and down to earth, or anyone who quenches their desire to be free. As soon as they feel obligated to do anything, they will start pulling away and any emotion that might have been developing will suddenly be covered by the fear of commitment and the rut of everyday life.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they want to reach emotional balance, Scorpio has to be untied, realize that their partner will never belong to them and that they are free to leave anytime. They will have to understand that this relationship might end tomorrow and there is nothing they can do about it but accept it. On the other hand, Aquarius will have to confront their emotional depth and be ready to make certain changes in their approach to romantic relationships, so they can steadily feel understand Scorpio’s emotional nature.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Values":{"Value":30,"Description":"They will both value excitement and change and this will be a strong meeting point for their characters. Unfortunately, most of the other things they would value in their partner are completely different. While Aquarius values free spirit, communication and independence, Scorpio values commitment, sex and deep emotional connection.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Activities":{"Value":60,"Description":"For as long as they stay out of their ego battle, they could find many things to do together. They will both like to take risks of any kind and their best date could be anything from parachute jumping to a night out in a casino. The best way for them to spend some quality time together is in some sort of intellectual activities and competitions, because this would allow them to manifest their possible hostility in a healthy way."},"Summary":{"Value":30,"Description":"Someone might say that this is a karmic relationship, that these partners were enemies in one of their previous lives and that they could fight until one of them falls dead. This would be a bit extreme though. The truth is, Scorpio is the sign of Uranus’ exaltation and as such, it adores Aquarius in a way. In most cases, Scorpio partner will show their affection obsessively, but this might actually feel good for Aquarius. When we look at the sign of Aquarius, we will see that it exalts Neptune, the ruler of a Water sign of Pisces, and all of our assumptions on their lack of emotionality will drown in their ultimate love.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fact is they are both in a way outcasts and rebels. While Scorpio represents all of our emotions we don’t want to deal with, Aquarius represents the way of thinking most of us are not ready for. It is best to look at them as announcers of change, for this is exactly what they will bring into each other’s lives."}},"Pisces":{"Love":{"Value":70,"Description":"As two Water signs, both Scorpio and Pisces find it very important for emotions to be the most intense part of their sexual experiences. Scorpio is a sign that represents sex, as well as sexual repression, and depending on the upbringing and previous sexual experiences, they can be a bit rough on their sensitive Pisces partner. On the other hand, Pisces is a sign of orgasms, strange sexual experiences and all of the sexual weirdness. If they understand the emotional depth of Scorpio, they might be much more resilient than we would assume.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe biggest challenge for these partners is their relation to Venus, the planet of sensual physical satisfaction. Scorpio doesn’t care for Venus very much, leading it to its detriment, while Pisces adore it through exaltation. This can be very unfortunate if Scorpio dismisses this emotional need of Pisces to be satisfied and loved at the same time. If Scorpio partner is aware of their animal nature and instinctive sexual desires, and in any touch with their feminine side ready to show it, Pisces will easily find a way to blend in their sexual world."},"Trust":{"Value":65,"Description":"Suspicious Scorpio can easily become a clingy, control freak in a relationship with Pisces. However, they will both be in search of their one, perfect love and this should bind them with certain honesty. As soon as one of them is cheated on or disappointed, their relationship should end, because none of these partners can handle the tainted image of love. Trust between them will be maintained for as long as Pisces have an idealistic approach, doing everything for their one true love. When their image clears and they realize who they are with and what their relationship looks like, it might become very difficult for them to stay in loop with Scorpio’s expectation of honesty."},"Intellect":{"Value":90,"Description":"The possible problems in communication between Scorpio and Pisces are either the roughness of Scorpio or excessive sensitivity of Pisces. With these two combined, it will be almost impossible to have a healthy conversation in which there will be no hurt, distance or anger. They will rarely fight, for Pisces partner usually has no reason to fight with anyone, but they could have a lot of misunderstandings that lead to their separation pretty quick.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Scorpio partner is tender enough and Pisces partner possesses the needed boundaries, their communication can be pretty exciting and magical. Both of these signs are linked to different types of magic, and they will both be interested in the “behind the scenes” view on everything that surrounds them. As they start to communicate and get out of their silent zones, they could easily get carried away in topics most signs wouldn’t understand.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe emotional approach to everything in their lives will help them understand each other when it comes to rational choices, too. The most superficial experiences will become something incredible to talk about, and the truth behind everything in life will be mesmerizing. They should hold on to the fascination with each other, instead of giving in to their weaknesses.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Emotions":{"Value":99,"Description":"If any sign other than Scorpio is capable of understanding Scorpio, it is Pisces. There is an emotional depth to Scorpio that not everyone is ready to face and Pisces are ready to face anything in the field of emotions. The sign of Pisces represents our oceans and seas, while Scorpio represents rivers. Each river flows into the ocean or the sea, and this reflects the emotional connection between these signs in the best possible way.\\r\\n\\r\\nPisces partner will have the ability to disperse the intensity of emotion from their Scorpio partner. This will allow them both to breathe more easily, for as long as they don’t cross the line and endanger the part of this depth that is loved by Scorpio. This is a special connection in which Scorpio partner needs to focus their emotions and Pisces partner needs to give them a purpose. However difficult and dark they both might get, they will share a deep emotional understanding that should be followed to see where their relationship will lead."},"Values":{"Value":75,"Description":"As much as Scorpio values someone’s strength of character and depth, Pisces will value sensitivity and width. Still, their mutual love for a connection with emotions and the depth of their emotional connection, will give them just enough shared values to hold on to. Scorpio is a sign ruled by Mars and there is always a certain admiration for chivalry. Pisces represent all the fairytales in which a prince became a hero and married a beautiful girl. Pisces partner has a mission to teach Scorpio how to reach their fairytale through chivalry, and they should both stay focused on creating their shared dreamland, royalty or not."},"Activities":{"Value":85,"Description":"When it comes to activities they could share, they will probably be inseparable whatever they do. If Scorpio gets tied to their Pisces partner, this might become tiresome for both of them, for too much scattered activity of Pisces can be irritating for focused Scorpio and the obsessive nature of Scorpio might weigh Pisces down. Still, they will have enough energy to follow each other and it should be easy for them to find shared interests. The main problem with the time they spend together could be the unconscious negativity of Scorpio partner. It might endanger the positive, happy image of the world Pisces want to carry around and this could push Pisces partner away if their emotional connection is not strong enough to keep them together."},"Summary":{"Value":81,"Description":"When Scorpio and Pisces come together, this relationship will probably give them both new insights on emotional possibilities. They will both easily get carried away into an image of a fairytale love, and this image could keep them together for a very long time, even if they are both not that happy. As two Water signs, they will rely on their emotional judgments and understand this about each other, creating true intimacy. The challenge here is for the nature of Scorpio not to obsess and suffocate their changeable partner, and for Pisces to stop running away from negative emotions.\\r\\n\\r\\n"}}},"Sagittarius":{"Aries":{"Love":{"Value":95,"Description":"This is a relationship disturbed mostly by the lack of trust and the ability of both parties to open up to their partner. Aries is ruled by Mars, the planet that rules our first chakra, responsible for our ability to set good boundaries. Pisces is ruled by Neptune, in charge of our entire aura and our permeability for outside stimuli. Since they are both responsible for our border with the outside world, it is hard to say which partner should loosen up and make it possible for them to come close. Their only chance of a happy ending is if Aries partner dives in and their Pisces partner wakes up.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Trust":{"Value":70,"Description":"Aries and Sagittarius are both aware of the excessive need for honesty in their life. Usually they don’t have to talk much to understand each other and can easily spot when the other one is lying. This makes it extremely hard to create a situation of mistrust, especially because of the feeling of security Sagittarius partner gives to Aries, by taking everything in with dignity and serenity. In most situations Aries feels they can share anything with their Sagittarius partner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem could appear if they have different views on the seriousness and depth of their relationship. If this is the case, usually a Sagittarius partner sees Aries as a short term, not that important partner. This is why they could easily cheat on them and probably wouldn’t even call it cheating. In return, Aries partner that values their relationship more, would jump into their possessive nature with even more ease and never trust their Sagittarius partner again.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Intellect":{"Value":90,"Description":"This is a wonderful bond that is often seen in friendships that last for years. Their mutual understanding can be so deep, that even if they lack physical attraction, they would gladly substitute it with a life spent in this kind of intellectual relationship. They motivate and push each other wherever they might like to go. When they are together, they make each other feel as if nothing is impossible. While Aries gives initiative and focus, Sagittarius gives vision and faith.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese signs are ruled by Mars and Jupiter, which means that they could have some disagreements on their convictions. In case these are not convictions they think of as their personality’s foundation, this shouldn’t be a huge problem. Still, it is possible for their set of beliefs to differ too much for them to even understand each other. When this happens, they fight whenever and wherever they can, since none of them has the ability to let their convictions go. Aries because they want to win, and Sagittarius because convictions are their forte and something they have surely thought about a lot."},"Emotions":{"Value":90,"Description":"When they fall in love with each other, deeply and sincerely, it is almost possible for their passers-by to warm up in the middle of winter. These are extremely warm signs, due to their corresponding element of Fire, open for any kind of activity just to share time together and feel that wonderful emotion in their stomach. This is a love that could last for a very long time, for as long as their respect their personal needs, individuality and the distance they possibly need from each other every once in a while.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough they are not considered very emotional, it is a mistake to assign emotionality only to the element of Water. This is an element which works from the heart and you can feel it in your chest. In search for an explanation of emotional nature of Fire signs, you should just imagine that warm feeling in your belly and that would be the best possible description. Their emotions are active, warm and on the move. Always changeable but creative and there to move them anywhere they want to go."},"Values":{"Value":70,"Description":"Aries partner values things that are brought up to a higher level by their Sagittarius. In time they will both understand that Aries grows through this relationship and widens their entire system of values. When they started dating, Aries probably had this idea of honor and heroic “sweep off feet” logic. In time, they both must have realized that Sagittarius gives this idea a new step up and brings it into a world of royalty. Not only does Sagittarius value honorable and heroic people, too, but they value honorable people with blue blood that give money and food to the poor, every day.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir main difference is in the fact that Aries values things concise and clear, while Sagittarius will easily disperse and go around the point for days. This can be met through their mutual value of truth, so honesty can be their cure for anything."},"Activities":{"Value":99,"Description":"Aries is a sign in which Saturn falls. This means that they easily get tired or just bored and they always need new and exciting stimulations. Sagittarius is a sign of mutable quality, ready to change whatever needs changing in order to feel good. When they get together, their activities can be shared and fun whatever they are. This has nothing to do with their needs and tendencies, but with the potential of their entire relationship. They can go for coffee and they would have fun, but they could also go bungee jumping together and have even more fun. It is all the same to them. They are fully capable of respecting each other’s personality, so even if their wishes for certain activities differ, this would be easily dealt with.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Summary":{"Value":87,"Description":"This is definitely a couple with lots of potential. They might have to stand up to their environment and defend their feelings from others, but this won’t shake them too much, for neither of them thinks that much about the opinion of others anyway. If they manage to mend their philosophical differences and respect each other’s different opinions, they could become one of the warmest relationships in the zodiac. Their main relationship advice would be to always tell the truth to each other and not go crazy about their healthy differences. Their differences are exactly the thing that could make their sexual life more exciting."}},"Taurus":{"Love":{"Value":25,"Description":"When Taurus thinks of sexuality, Sagittarius is probably the last person on their mind. With their childish attitude that changes with the weather, there seems to be no room for any sexual activity in their life. Although this is a delusion, these signs are too far apart in their basic character to understand each other’s sexuality. Sagittarius would probably think of Taurus as a person who eats and sleeps all day long. There is nothing sexual about it, right?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is interesting though, how two people ruled by two beneficent planets such as Venus and Jupiter can’t seem to find sexual satisfaction. The fact is – they can. Although this is a rare scenario, they could actually use their attributes to enhance sexual pleasure Venus would offer. If they understood each other as two individuals who deserve respect, they could find the missing link for a very interesting and fulfilling sex life. Taurus would take care of their Sagittarius partner and keep them satisfied. In return they would get a cheerful soul who knows how to make their relationship exciting. There is so much to be learned about the “light side” of sexuality here, and this could be a fun experience if Taurus loosened up a little and Sagittarius slowed down."},"Trust":{"Value":5,"Description":"The sign of Sagittarius is considered something like a synonym for honesty. It is true that representatives of this sign have no idea how to make up a lie, let alone tell it. Still, when it comes to romantic relationships, they often suffer from a Don Juan syndrome and can’t get enough attention from one partner. Taurus finds this repulsive at best, and if a relationship with a Sagittarius partner begins and they start acting this way, there is a big chance they will get dumped.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrust between these partners isn’t something to be questioned and analyzed. If they do trust each other they can have a wonderful, trusting relationship for a while, but there is still no guarantee on how long this could last. If they don’t, it won’t be mended whatever they try to do. Usually loss of trust here simply breaks up the relationship and they both go their separate ways with no regret."},"Intellect":{"Value":50,"Description":"There are so many beautiful things in the world, and so much to talk about when you think about them. Taurus and Sagittarius both have this joy about them that can be awaken by their relationship. With the Moon exalted in Taurus and Jupiter exalted in Cancer (ruled by the Moon), there is a certain feel, a soul, a tenderness to share between them. Their approaches to life are different, their characters incomparable, but the joy they can feel toward some things is completely the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they don’t find this shared feeling of joy, they could both learn what bad communication really is. In most cases they can talk about the weather and be fine, but when they have a problem, this turns into a ridiculous conversation that isn’t really a conversation at all. Sagittarius will want to jump out of their skin while waiting for Taurus to finish the sentence, as much as Taurus will look at their Sagittarius partner as a source of all stupidity.\\r\\n\\r\\nTaurus is your countryside and Sagittarius is the world, so their problems could easily include disrespect because of their origin or their goals. Although they will rarely end up in a fight or use ugly words, it can sometimes be too obvious how much they don’t care for each other’s worlds and how far apart they really are."},"Emotions":{"Value":25,"Description":"They are both connected with the Moon in a way, so there are some feelings to be shared. However, Sagittarius doesn’t normally react with much emotion to static, from their perspective boring Taurus nature. If Taurus was a bit more prone to temporary infatuations or platonic relationships, they could fall in love with a Sagittarius enough to overcome the differences between them. Sagittarius on the other hand, is often infatuated and temporarily in love. There is a great chance they will fall in love with a Taurus if they like their physical appearances, but they won’t last in those feelings for long enough to gently lead Taurus to mutual love.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir pace is off and they rarely get in sync with their emotions. Most relationships between a Taurus and a Sagittarius partner that manage to last, are those that started as a friendship and had a chance to develop emotionally for years without them actually being in a romantic relationship."},"Values":{"Value":60,"Description":"The combination of signs of Taurus and Sagittarius is a “flower child” full of love, understanding for the world and ultimately humane. They could support each other’s utopian worlds a bit too passionately, and this could lead to one of them, or both, being in a delusion about what reality is about. There is too much love and happiness in the world if they start sharing opinions and this can become like a drug to both of them. The practicality of Taurus will usually break this pattern and hit a counter-attack with their reality checks and material issues so they can both remember where their values part ways – to security and utter lack of it."},"Activities":{"Value":20,"Description":"Food. That is mostly what they both would share. Taurus might not actually share food with joy, but they will certainly like to share the activity of eating. It could be quite easy for them to find other things to do together, too. The problem will surface the moment Taurus wants to go home and spend an evening in their warm bed, while Sagittarius’ fun has just begun. They don’t share the same passion toward the same things, and although they might have fun being together, their priorities are not the same. The Fire energy of Sagittarius will be put off by Taurus’ Earth personality and this will be tedious for both of them."},"Summary":{"Value":31,"Description":"With their inner beauty and the understanding they share in search of the truth to life, these two might seem as a perfect couple. However, every positive needs a negative to complete it, and when we really observe, we can notice that often a Taurus and a Sagittarius don’t even get attracted to each other. Taurus needs earthly pleasures in their relationships and as a fixed, Earth sign it is the slowest of all signs. This is not exactly someone who can easily understand the fast, changeable and fiery Sagittarius.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best possible scenario for their relationship would be for them to get to know each other very well and build a friendship without expectations, for years. In the end, this could result in deep understanding that would provide them both with enough patience to actually start a relationship that has a future. If not, they can always hold on to beauty in the world. Imagine how wonderful their world of creation could be if they joined their forces of good."}},"Gemini":{"Love":{"Value":90,"Description":"Gemini and Sagittarius have this strange approach to sex, childish and light as if they don’t really care about it. When they get together, they usually get strangely involved in emotions none of them really understands. Their sex life is something to cherish, easy, open and with no pressure at any side. They will both enjoy their sexual relations, followed by laughter, creativity and joy. As two children in bodies of grown-ups, they could go through the feeling of shame together if they don\'t have much experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they meet a bit older, there is a slim chance that both of them didn’t have enough sexual experiences and partners to understand their personal needs and desires. This can make them both a bit selfish, but if their communication keeps going, there is no reason why this would be a turn off for anyone.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a strange thing, but sex is really not that important to these partners. They are looking for someone to complete their mental personalities, someone to talk to and give them a sense of purpose. This is why they could decide to stay friends after a breakup, for their starting premise was in building a strong relationship founded on their personalities, rather than their sexual or emotional natures.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Trust":{"Value":99,"Description":"If anyone can understand the need of their partner to not be faithful, it’s these two. Strangely enough, this can lead to ultimate faithfulness, for there will be no more excitement in the secrecy and mystery of parallel relationships. Sagittarius is not someone who can tell a lie and keep a straight face, and they are usually really disturbed by the lies of other people. Gemini can tell a lie with such ease that they sometimes don’t even know they’re lying. When they get together, this all becomes something to have fun with and they could play a game of trust until they build it on strong foundations of mutual respect."},"Intellect":{"Value":99,"Description":"Wow! This kind of understanding is truly something to cherish. A problem can surface when they are both preoccupied with chasing their personal values and don’t see what they have with each other. As opposing signs they complement each other in general, but this is strongly sensed in this segment of their relationship. With Gemini’s ideas and mind flow, there is nothing Sagittarius can’t learn or share, being a student and a teacher at the same time. The curiosity goes both ways and they will spend days just learning about each other and absorbing shared experiences.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only thing that can interfere with the quality of their mental connection is the possible fear of intimacy that builds in the meantime. That strength of personal exchange stops being mental and starts being emotional at some point, and as two signs that aren’t exactly emotional to begin with, they can be frightened by the intensity of emotions that are surfacing when they are together.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general, this is a couple you want to hang out with, every day. They will literally share happiness with one another and with those around them. They can inspire anyone to love and to smile, because when in love, they will laugh so sincerely and have so much fun together. The “here-and-there” nature of Gemini will get new meaning and purpose through the eyes of their Sagittarius, while the search for the ultimate truth can be so much easier for a Sagittarius with the mind of a Gemini. Their optimism and their eloquence will multiply, day after day, until one of them gets scared and decides to take off or death do them part."},"Emotions":{"Value":95,"Description":"It is kind of strange to think about the emotional side of the relationship between a Gemini and a Sagittarius. Both signs have a non-emotional feel to them, but their contact develops so much emotion that maybe neither one of them will be able to cope with it. They are not used to feeling that much, and when they “click”, Sagittarius could discover the new meaning of life and Gemini a synthesis that they’ve never had a chance to experience. This can truly be a fascinating love story, if only they don’t run away from all that emotion."},"Values":{"Value":70,"Description":"There is this important thing they both value – things that make sense. As opposing signs it might seem that Gemini is scattered and superficial, while Sagittarius is collected and deep, but in fact they have the same core in the fact that everything needs to make sense.

Their Mercury can’t deal with senseless words, stories without meaning and purpose, whatever that purpose may be."},"Activities":{"Value":99,"Description":"Not only will they share every activity that any of them thinks of, but they will also laugh all the way, whatever they decide to do together. This positive emotion and pure joy they can share, becomes something like a happy drug to both of them and they no longer want to be apart. As two mutable signs, they understand each other’s changeability and flexibility, perfectly capable to find all the right reasons why everything they do makes perfect sense. There is a point when they will get irritating to their surroundings, like two spoiled children without a care in the world, but while they are this happy – why would they care?"},"Summary":{"Value":92,"Description":"Gemini and Sagittarius make an incredible couple, probably being the most innocent one of all oppositions in the zodiac. They don’t often find each other right away, but at some point in life it is almost certain that a Gemini will find their Sagittarius and vice versa. Their relationship has a strong intellectual connection, in which they will gradually find deep emotions. There is no real prognosis how this will end though, because the emotions they feel could easily scare them away and their relationship could end only because of fear. If they decide to give in and find out what they could share, with Gemini’s ideas and Sagittarius’ beliefs, the sky is the limit. Or is it beyond?"}},"Cancer":{"Love":{"Value":40,"Description":"Cancer and Sagittarius will almost never get attracted to each other. If they do, against odds, they could find an interesting shared sexual language that none of them anticipated will be found. The changeable nature of Sagittarius can be somewhat difficult for Cancer to understand because of their opposite need for emotional security. If trust between them is reached in any possible way and true emotions are shared, this characteristic of a Sagittarius partner will become a spice to their sex life, rather than its destructive force.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they have enough emotional security with one another, their sex life could be very fun. Cancer is a sign that exalts Jupiter, and will probably make their partner feel special. On the other hand, Sagittarius will make things light, fun and although the lack of depth could bother Cancer, passion and warmth they bring into their sex life might just be enough to compensate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only way their relationship can succeed is for Cancer to let go of their preconceptions and allows some change and fun enter their strict sex zone. Although they can seem mellow most of the time, they have a tendency to hold on to secure patterns when it comes to things that can make them feel shame or insecurity. In return, Sagittarius will have to lower their expectations on Cancer’s own changeability and sexual creativity, and be satisfied with lovemaking instead of a sexual adventure."},"Trust":{"Value":1,"Description":"Sagittarius is a sign ruled by Jupiter. Deities associated with this planet were considered great lovers, always on the chase for different women, goddesses, nymphs, and whoever seemed attractive enough. More often than not, Sagittarius representatives have the need to show their seductive skills to everyone around them and we could call this a “Zeus’ complex”.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the sign of Cancer loves Jupiter very much, emotions make it impossible for them to understand this flirty need of their partner to win the hearts of everyone around them. Not only will this disturb Cancer’s trust, but it will also affect the trust Sagittarius has in the understanding they will get from their partner. This could be the source of many conflicts and misunderstandings, and could finally lead to the point where their relationship has no purpose or future at all."},"Intellect":{"Value":60,"Description":"Both of these signs strive for knowledge, pure and simple. Their mutual love for it will give them plenty of things to talk about and a deep understanding of each other’s reasoning. Their minds need to find the synthesis of things that surround them and their belief systems can be quite similar. The wonderful thing of their mutual love of Jupiter is exactly in the similarities between their minds and their ways of thinking.\\r\\n\\r\\nCancer can seem a bit slow from Sagittarius’ perspective, as much as Sagittarius can seem superficial or too “philosophical” to Cancer. They can easily overcome these issues if they find a passion they share and usually if these two choose the same profession, they have many things to talk about. They understand each other’s mind and the way their brain works, even when there is a large intellectual difference between them. If they happen to fall in love, communication is something they can always use as means to solve any other problem that appears in the course of their relationship."},"Emotions":{"Value":10,"Description":"This is not a combination of Sun signs that will fall in love very often. As elements of Water and Fire, they don’t really spark each other’s passion and the love between them will hardly ever be the same intensity, at the same time or the same pace. Sagittarius is a mutable Fire sign and they usually fall in love quickly and passionately. If their love is to last, their partner needs to surprise and impress them often, making the relationship exciting and unpredictable.\\r\\n\\r\\nCancer, on the other hand, is a cardinal Water sign, and they will make sharp turns and huge changes, but much less frequently than their partner. Cancers follow their feel of situations and people, and need time to build a relationship in which they feel secure enough to share emotions. When love happens between them, usually Sagittarius feels it first, wants to jump in and out and in and out enough times for Cancer to realize that they cannot build this sense of security to even consider their relationship a true love.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they are to build a love that will last, Sagittarius partner will have to slow down and wait until their partner decides how they feel. In return, Cancer will have to take a leap of faith and jump into a relationship that offers no security, to see if enough love can be found between them so they can stay together."},"Values":{"Value":45,"Description":"Although they value different things and different characteristics in people around them, they have a strong link in the way they value knowledge.

Sagittarius will look at their partner as if the entire person just turned into a long, irritating pause. The way these signs use their energy is so different that it is not only difficult to find activities they will do together, but more importantly it is difficult for them to do things in a similar way. This could make the possible impossible and they could be forever separated by a simple difference in their speed."},"Summary":{"Value":27,"Description":"Cancer and Sagittarius are usually signs that aren’t attracted to each other at all. If attraction and love are born between them, they will rarely have a damaging relationship for any one of them, because their signs are ruled by the Moon and beneficent Jupiter. It is safe to assume that they will be good for each other, for as long as their relationship lasts, but it is rare for them to succeed in the long run if they don’t have strong support from positions in their personal horoscopes. As much as Cancer can reach the depth of their partner’s faith, Sagittarius can widen their partner’s horizons and make them much happier in their approach to the world. If they have feelings for each other, it would be a shame not to act on them and miss the opportunity to peacefully grow."}},"Leo":{"Love":{"Value":99,"Description":"As two fire signs, one of them fixed and one of them mutable, Leo and Sagittarius share a warm love for each other. When they start dating, their sexual relationship might come as a surprise for both of them, for they will feel liberated to be exactly who they are with each other. The best thing they could do is use the trine between their Suns and build-up each other’s self-esteem, especially if they have been in demanding or disrespectful relationships prior to theirs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best thing about their sex life is the passion they share. Leo is there to bring inner fire for the act of sex, and Sagittarius to fire up the expansion, the places, positions and horizons. They will both enjoy each other in a fiery way and respect each other’s bodies, minds and entire personalities. If they stumble upon one another and love is born, their sex life could represent a perfect connection for both of them.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Trust":{"Value":80,"Description":"Since they spark each other’s sense of security and confidence, they will rarely show jealousy or misunderstand each other’s actions. Leo does like to be the center of attention and feel attractive and desirable, but this is something a Sagittarius partner can provide in abundance. There is usually no reason for them to lose trust over time, except when their emotions start to fade. Sagittarius is a mutable sign, and as such, they can fall in and out of love quickly and frequently. In case Leo starts feeling left out and unloved, the suspicion will rise, and what better way to respond to suspicion than by becoming suspicious yourself, Sagittarius might think. Although they both might be unaware of the root of their issues when trust is lost, it is usually a simple lack of love."},"Intellect":{"Value":85,"Description":"Leo and Sagittarius are both very focused on their mental activity. Leo because they are ruled by the Sun and this gives them a certain rational awareness and Sagittarius because they always aim higher from the Earth, philosophical and wide opinionated. This is something that will help them communicate about almost anything, even though their interests might differ and their backgrounds as well. Leo has the ability to help Sagittarius when they get lost, and this could happen often if their plans are grand. Sagittarius will give Leo vision and the ability to understand the future of their current creative efforts. Together, they make an important part of the process of creation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs two highly aware individuals with a strong sense of Selves and their personalities, they could build up an incredible understanding. They can both be loud, communicate a lot, and this could make their relationship truly remarkable, deepening their intimacy through openness they share to get into each other’s worlds. Since they both have a strong personality, they will not feel threatened by each other’s character and each other’s strength of opinions and convictions. The only thing they might lack is the sensibility to outer influences and their fiery relationship could make them a bit too rough on each other, and on themselves. Still, the power of creativity and their active approach to life should keep them interested in one another and very well connected for a long time."},"Emotions":{"Value":80,"Description":"As two Fire signs, Leo and Sagittarius tend to be very passionate and open in showing how they feel. They will want to show their love, share their love and act on their impulses as much as they can. This can sometimes be too much, for no passive, fragile emotions or energy will be respected. Some balance would come in handy, especially if they often fight. Conflicts between them could be quite aggressive, not because they are that aggressive themselves, but because two fires build an even larger fire. It is almost like they might explode if they both go too far.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they fall in love, this seems like the warmest, cuddly love on planet Earth. In most cases, this will be enough to overcome any difficulties in their way, but sometimes these partners both tend to forget their actual sensitivity. They have to understand when the time has come to slow down, stay at home, talk about nothing at all and just be quiet. If they don’t, they will probably turn to someone who can give them this kind of peace from time to time."},"Values":{"Value":65,"Description":"They will most certainly value each other’s strength of character and incredible personalities, the ability to warm each other up in every possible way and the passion they carry within, each for their own purposes. Still, it is not easy to explain to a Leo why it is so good to run away from the world, travel in Greenland alone, and eat bugs somewhere in Asia, except if one wants to show their courage. On the other hand, Sagittarius doesn’t really understand why they would go to fancy places and confront all the people that it is easier to run from. This is not a consequence of a lack of courage, but the lack of meaning they feel when they need to spend their time on tiresome people. So although they value the same thing – courage, they see it through different eyes."},"Activities":{"Value":40,"Description":"We would think that Leo likes to travel just as much as Sagittarius. They have the energy and the need to search for knowledge and widen their horizons, but they don’t exactly like to move that much. This is due to their fixed nature, and although they would like to visit any possible part of the world, they wouldn’t do it at the same pace as Sagittarius, nor would they choose the same destinations. Sagittarius, on the other hand, doesn’t really understand why Leo wants to perform in front of so many people when there are starving children in Africa. These are simplified examples, but they serve us pretty well to understand how well they might work together, travel together, perform together, but only if they are open enough to ad purpose and strength to their approaches.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Summary":{"Value":75,"Description":"Leo and Sagittarius are a very good fiery combination of signs, and when two people with these Sun signs come together, they inevitably fall in love. This love is warm, passionate and inspiring, and they will have a chance to create, perform and have fun together for as long as they feel this way. However, Sagittarius partner might lose interest in Leo because they tend to get pushed away by their static, fixed nature. The only way they might get to keep their passion and emotions going, is if they manage to listen to their softer emotions and remain tender and sensitive for one another.\\r\\n\\r\\n"}},"Virgo":{"Love":{"Value":30,"Description":"Just like all mutable sign combinations, these partners could have a lot of fun. Even though Virgo can be quite demanding and critical, especially from the point of view of Sagittarius, their sex life can be satisfying for both. The good thing about their connection lies in a fact that these signs are ruled by planets that also rule their opposing signs. This means that they will feel attraction and a need to begin a sexual relationship in the first place.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main problem here is in the difference in their elements. Virgo is an Earth sign, and as such, doesn’t often take too many risks. Sagittarius is a Fire sign, and they will passionately force things until they reach their goal. This doesn’t work well in their sexual contact, for Virgo might feel pushed into things they don’t want to do, and Sagittarius might be turned off by the practical and static nature of Virgo. The most important thing these partners should remember is that they both need room to be who they are. With two such giving people, sex life comes down to who will satisfy whom best, as soon as they deal with unrealistic expectations.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Trust":{"Value":1,"Description":"If you dig for the biggest problem in the relationship between a Virgo and a Sagittarius partner, you will realize that it is their lack of trust, not only in each other, but in their entire relationship. As friends, they can be unshakeable about their convictions and hold on to some traditional values together, but as soon as they start a romantic relationship, both of them seem to start feeling trapped.\\r\\n\\r\\nVirgo doesn’t look like a zodiac sign that will easily feel trapped, but their mutable quality makes them impatient and always in search for change. They cannot be held in one place for long, any more than a Sagittarius can. The main difference being the degree of sacrifice they are willing to make. Out of these emotions, both partners will start feeling the need to be with someone different, and this is a relationship with probably the biggest potential for adultery, unless incredible guilt stops them first. Communication followed by mutual respect is their only chance of building a trustful bond."},"Intellect":{"Value":65,"Description":"There is so much to say when Virgo and Sagittarius come together, and even though these partners might spark each other’s need to talk excessively, all the time, they will both feel quite good about it. If they hit the zone of real understanding, they will be excited about the use of their minds and the beautiful conclusions and philosophy they can create together. Virgo will bring all the little pieces into their intellectual connection, while a Sagittarius will have vision and help create a bigger picture. Even though they don’t complement each other anywhere close to their opposing signs, the intellectual excitement will be equally important to them from the start.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most relevant fact for these partners to remember is that their respect is the most important thing to hold on to. If they disrespect one another, Virgo will observe their Sagittarius partner as a weirdo, stupid enough to run away from anything that has depth, while Sagittarius will look at their Virgo partner as a weirdo, stupid enough to hold on to irrelevant things. They need to remember that each of them has a different role, and that for each role, these “stupid” characteristics represent the best possible base."},"Emotions":{"Value":10,"Description":"This is not exactly a couple that will often end up in a happily ever after, even though they both wish to find the right person for this more than anything. In most cases, their vision of a fairytale ending differs too much for them to have it with one together. Still, in some rare situations, their mutable natures allow them to move in the same pace with enough respect to stay in an emotional bond that satisfies them both.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth of these partners are considered unemotional, but this is mostly because of their need to rationalize, analyze and use their minds to explain everything that happens to them, rather than rely on their hearts or gut feelings. This will often be a problem, for Virgo needs someone truly emotional so they can show their own deep feelings. Sagittarius seems to be uninterested in needs of Virgo or simply unaware of them because they act as if they are purely rational. The trick here is for both partners to see behind the act in order to find each other’s hearts and understand what they can expect from one another."},"Values":{"Value":50,"Description":"Virgo and Sagittarius will strangely have similar values based on their mutable quality. This is why they will both treasure someone able to adapt, change and move, which is definitely something they will find in each other as they start their relationship. As highly mental signs, they will also both value clarity of mind and intelligence, in general. Still, their approach to intellectual value is different, and as much as Virgo values depth and detailed analysis, Sagittarius will value the width of one’s mind. Even though they differ in other things they value greatly, Virgo valuing practicality and Sagittarius vision and focus, there is enough common ground here for both of them to feel good when together."},"Activities":{"Value":35,"Description":"Virgo and Sagittarius will strangely have similar values based on their mutable quality.

There are many challenges in their way, the biggest being their emotional lack of understanding and their possible lack of respect. Still, when they find a way to show emotions and share them in the same pace and in an understandable way, they could actually have a lot of fun together. Their communication is often exciting and they both have a lot to say to each other, but their rationality may distract them from an actual search for love. If they discover how well they complement each other, they might be able to stay together for a long time.\\r\\n\\r\\n"}},"Libra":{"Love":{"Value":90,"Description":"The intensity of emotional contact and intimacy between a Libra and a Sagittarius will mostly depend on other factors in personal charts, but they will most certainly enjoy their sexual relationship. They are a very good match when it comes to sexuality, for no partner here feels pressured and there is just enough room for both of them to grow, develop, build their self-esteem and feel secure in each other’s arms.\\r\\n\\r\\nRuled by two benefic planets, Venus and Jupiter, their main objective is to form an enjoyable sexual relationship, with a primary goal to make each other happy. For this goal, they will experiment a lot, and try out new things, everything followed by a smile and a sense of lightness, as if sex wasn’t really a big deal in the first place. The seriousness of Libra linked to its exaltation of Saturn will give their entire relationship endurance and stability, while their ruling Venus working together with Jupiter, gives enough romance, sexual desire, tenderness and might lead them to a fairytale ending. This combination of planets forms Neptune in a way, and speaks of the growth of satisfaction leading to orgasmic pleasure, even though both signs might not seem at all sexual to some other members of the zodiac.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Trust":{"Value":5,"Description":"As stated above, rulers of Libra and Sagittarius are closely linked to Neptune and the challenge of trust is one of the most important experiences that this relationship gives. They can both go to extremes, either having unrealistic faith in each other or mistrusting every word and every action that is made. The only way to keep the image of trust for these signs seems to be to always stay in a fairytale, unrealistic state, and this is something a Sagittarius will never want to do. If truth isn’t lived, nothing in the world is beautiful for a Sagittarian Sun. As soon as they start their search for something different, Libra will sense the change and become frustrated by their inability to create oneness with a partner they love.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Intellect":{"Value":85,"Description":"It is wonderful to watch how soft Libra gets, forgetting about Saturn and their own responsibility, as Sagittarius’ childish nature melts their heart. Even if this isn’t something with a promising future, for no one can run from their true nature, it will bring them both joy and happiness at least for a little while. Libra partner will be able to relax next to someone who doesn’t judge, and Sagittarius partner will feel like their energy is well focused on someone that needs some youth, warmth, light, optimism and creativity in their life.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor as long as they don’t brush on ego problems, their communication and intellectual compatibility are a given. The main problem that will eventually surface and need to be dealt with, is in the forces of their Suns. Libra’s Sun is weak, and they will easily give the wheel to someone else who will make positive decisions and moves for them. Sagittarius has too much fiery energy in their Sun, active, taking action and always prepared to give some of it even if nobody asked for it in the first place. This could lead to a subtle, hidden, will imposing and a character shift that will leave them both bruised for respect when a light is finally shed on the issue."},"Emotions":{"Value":99,"Description":"This is one of the most compatible couples when it comes to the emotional side of their relationship. It is not easy for any one of them to find love and share it with someone. They are, after all, an Air and a Fire sign. Even though Libra is ruled by Venus, it is linked to the mental processes, social adaptation and communication through its element, while Sagittarius has passionate feelings, but uses their head, spreading their philosophy, more than actually feeling.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they get together, they seem to be able to find a balance in which both of them use their heads just enough, and give each other enough room for love to be born. This is a bond that gives both partners the opportunity to understand how deep their emotions can go, as beneficent rulers make way for feelings to surface in a supporting atmosphere. Even though their relationship is not always meant to be the one they will stay in for life, it could prepare them for a love they seek, giving them a glimpse of what they are capable of."},"Values":{"Value":75,"Description":"These partners will value the strength of mind in a way that is understandable only to them. Libra doesn’t seem like a creative person to others, but a Sagittarius sees their intellect through communication and motivates them to show their warmth. This leads to shared value of their entire relationship and an intellectual understanding that gives them room to build their shared philosophy. Even if they don’t start their relationship in the same place, they will have the opportunity to build similar values in time, showing each other what’s truly important."},"Activities":{"Value":70,"Description":"Even though we could easily assume that a Libra and a Sagittarius will have lots of things to do together, there is a great chance that their choices of activities won’t be so similar. Libra wants to stick to their usual routine, and make fieldtrips to things that interest them from time to time. Sagittarius wants to move from any routine and live a life travelling the world. There are exceptions to this rule, of course, and there are uplifted Libras that will want to travel the world, as much as there are Sagittarius representatives that want to follow a certain trail, while fantasizing about their reality. However, in most cases, their needs won’t fit that well and they will probably face the challenge of their usual ego battle while choosing what to do together."},"Summary":{"Value":71,"Description":"The relationship of Libra and Sagittarius is in most cases a beneficent bond that allows these partners to develop their emotional, inner worlds and build their lives without negative influences. However, there is an archetypal battle between them, for Saturn exalts in Libra and doesn’t really care for his son, Jupiter, the ruler of Sagittarius. This could easily lead to a struggle for supremacy and a battle to reach the ruling position among them. This comes as a continuation of Libra’s bruised Sun and a Sagittarius will fit in perfectly with the need to give away every sense of pride out of some childish convictions. The only way for them to be happy together, is to respect each other fully and let each other do what they are meant to do. Libra should stick to their relationship and love, ruled by Venus, while Sagittarius should stick to their convictions and width, ruled by Jupiter, multiplying the love Libra provides."}},"Scorpio":{"Love":{"Value":25,"Description":"There is a strange understanding between these two signs, as if they were one and the same, at least for a little while. The strength of character they share is something that will give them just the right amount of confidence when it comes to sex, and the creativity and openness of Sagittarius will be refreshing for the fixed nature of Scorpio. However, this often doesn’t last very long and in time, in most cases, Scorpio starts thinking of their Sagittarius partner as unreliable and not to be trusted, while Sagittarius sees Scorpio as dark, pushy and too controlling.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to remain in a healthy sexual relationship, both of these partners have to compromise, Scorpio finding a way to give freedom, while Sagittarius finding a way not to run away from the seriousness of their partner. In the best possible contact, Scorpio will give their sex life emotion and true physical intimacy, while Sagittarius will be there to give meaning and shake things up, representing the light at the end of a tunnel. Together, they can build an incredible sexual relationship, for both tend to be uninhibited about locations, positions and situations in which they wish to make love."},"Trust":{"Value":1,"Description":"The biggest problem for a Scorpio and a Sagittarius in a relationship is trust. Scorpio has the need to tie their partner down, even if they have that seemingly liberating view on love. There is nothing a Sagittarius will dread more than someone trying to control their life. If someone can spark the need of Sagittarius to be unfaithful, it is most definitely Scorpio, launching them further and further away by trying to come closer. An additional problem with this couple is in the quality of their signs, Scorpio being fixed and Sagittarius mutable. This makes it almost impossible for them to share a pace, and in order not to disappoint each other, they both might choose to lie. The strangest thing in this relationship is in the fact that these two signs are, without a doubt, the most honest signs of the zodiac. Still, their relationship seems to face them with the other side of their personality, one none of them wants to see.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Intellect":{"Value":80,"Description":"Two such strong individuals give each other exactly what each of them needs when it comes to their mental compatibility. Not only does Scorpio feel lighter, more optimistic about life and everything in it when communicating with a Sagittarius, but the depth they give to Sagittarius’ mind and ways to reach conclusions is impossible for any other sign. Scorpio will face Sagittarius with any superficial or outdated views, while being compassionate enough to know how to do this without hurting them, and being fixed enough not to change their intent somewhere along the way when Sagittarius thinks of running away.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey will enjoy each other’s company for as long as expectations and emotional disagreements are not in focus, for they have an incredible thing to share – their search for truth. The meaning they seek in all things in life, Scorpio going into depth and Sagittarius traveling wide, will connect them through a strong bond that no other combination of signs can form. If they are on a shared mission, they can accomplish incredible things and have real epiphanies together."},"Emotions":{"Value":10,"Description":"They will enjoy each other’s company for as long as expectations and emotional disagreements are not in focus, for they have an incredible thing to share – their search for truth.

They can both feel like outcasts and value each other’s decisions to differ from others out of self-respect. Still, in most cases they will easily consider each other invaluable in a way, for they cannot meet the expectations each of them has for his partner’s personality. The only way for them to value each other, is to focus on the positive characteristics and sides of one another and their entire contact."},"Activities":{"Value":30,"Description":"For as long as their communication is inspiring for both partners, they won’t need much to be satisfied by their activities. Sagittarius will want to try anything new and Scorpio’s approach to life is always new from their perspective, while Scorpio will enjoy the first impulse of optimism and fun. It is a good thing that Scorpio exalts Uranus, for this gives them enough love for change and exciting, new things that Sagittarius can bring into their lives. However, the fixed quality of Scorpio will make this exhilaration fade as soon as their relationship becomes routine, in any way. As time passes, there is a great chance for Sagittarius to start feeling pressured, or simply be bored, and this doesn’t give great promise of future."},"Summary":{"Value":30,"Description":"Scorpio and Sagittarius make a pretty great couple, for as long as they feel the first excitement at the start of their relationship. While they don’t know each other well and everything seems new and incredible, Scorpio will see their Sagittarius partner as a ray of light that suddenly makes their life brighter and better, while Sagittarius will see that there is so much to learn and enjoy the depth of their Scorpio partner, followed by emotional attachment. In time, there is a strong chance they will slowly lose interest in one another, especially the mutable sign of Sagittarius for their fixed Scorpio partner. Even though their relationship might end on bad terms, it would be a shame not to give in to it and let it fascinate and exalt both of them for however long."}},"Sagittarius":{"Love":{"Value":65,"Description":"When you think of two Sagittarius partners in a sexual relationship, you might as well think of two teenagers that find everything funny. This is a beneficent relationship, but it can be superficial and very short-lasting. Both of these partners think a lot, have their own liberal philosophy, and are easily pulled together in a series of one-night stands or casual sexual activity that no other sign would jump into. Sagittarius is a mutable sign, making both of them change with the slightest glimpse of a problem, and while they are satisfied with the unrestrained, liberating experience, they will remain as intimate as their minds allow them to.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem they might have to deal with is the lack of emotion and depth in their contact. Sagittarius is not often superficial, but when with another Sagittarius, their minds throw them in all sorts of different directions and there is not much room for genuine emotion. They can be madly in love, but still lack consistency in their emotional contact. This will influence their sex life and make it as changeable as they both are. Even though this won’t affect their overall satisfaction, it might cut their relationship short and make them understand they need to be with someone different."},"Trust":{"Value":99,"Description":"What possible reason could two Sagittarius partners have to not trust each other? They consider themselves the most honest in the entire zodiac, and they will have the ability to understand each other in this honesty. Even though the sign of Sagittarius has a tendency to show affection to several people at the same time, enjoying everything in abundance, when two of them come together, they simply won’t mind. The only possible reason for jealousy and mistrust in this contact rises from other personal pointers, rather than their Suns in the sign of Sagittarius."},"Intellect":{"Value":99,"Description":"The joy of this contact is something rarely anyone has a chance to feel except a Sagittarius with another Sagittarius. When they find shared interests and discover their similar convictions, there is nothing stopping them from exciting, passionate discussions in which it is finally easy for them to be who they are. One Sagittarius truly loves talking to another, and unless there is a hidden ego battle between them, they will rarely get angry or frustrated by anything their partner has to say.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach Sagittarius often has friends born in the same Sun sign, because no one else can understand their nature, cherish it, and awaken their inner child as their own reflection. When these Suns come together, their passion for things they do multiplies. For as long as there’s no judgment or a need to impose their will on one another, their time spent together will be incredibly valuable for both. Those smiles they share with everyone on this planet will be returned in just the right amount only by another Sagittarius."},"Emotions":{"Value":10,"Description":"Sagittarius is a sign not often described as emotional, but in fact their ruler, Jupiter, finds the place of its exaltation in Cancer, the ruler of all emotion. We might say that the real goal of every Sagittarius is to find this inner emotional peace, to find home, without running from difficulty, sadness and any emotion that needs to be dealt with. Each Sagittarius wants to be satisfied and happy, with no hidden intent, manipulation, dishonesty or any impurities. Their intentions are always good and they might help each other reach for their utopian goals when together.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, when these two begin their relationship, they understand the positivity and the optimism they share with clarity, but this lifts them even higher off the ground. If they feed each other’s inconsistencies and needs to run from any seriousness and reality, they could truly get lost on their search for love. The problem these partners have is not in the lack of love, but in the support of various directions that can move them away from their hearts. They often seem to need a bit more consistency to find the love they seek."},"Values":{"Value":99,"Description":"It is wonderful to watch two Jupiter’s minions play with their convictions and share values as if it was the most common thing on Earth. Even when they stumble upon a disagreement, there is a great chance they will laugh it off and forget about it in a couple of hours. The positivity of this clash of fiery Suns is something that can overcome any value previously set, and they will easily adapt to one another and find a perfect compromise, even when they disagree. The most important value they share is the one they both give to freedom of spirit and the goodness of humankind. When they find this point of shared utopia, there is nothing else that will truly matter."},"Activities":{"Value":70,"Description":"They can basically do anything together, if they manage to find each other. They are easily distracted by various things in their lives and aren’t very fixed on their agreements, seeking freedom and understanding from one another. When they are faced with their own weaknesses, one of them being that lack of responsibility and reliability, they can really get annoyed and angry. This is not typical, but it is very possible in case one of them doesn’t see themselves in a true light which can be expected from any Sagittarius. The best thing these partners could do is travel the world together, with a basis of a plan that is to be respected. No other sign can understand their need for travel, knowledge, width and distances, and this is something they should share and multiply when together."},"Summary":{"Value":74,"Description":"One Sagittarius will easily fall in love with the other and their passionate relationship can change very fast. As two representatives of a mutable sign, they will adapt easily, but change their opinions and feelings toward each other with a similar ease.

This doesn’t mean they won’t enjoy each other’s company, find many things to share while they are together, and laugh as children while being on the same path.

Even when they are attracted to each other and form a sexual bond, after their time has passed they will probably feel like they shouldn’t have been together. There is no logical explanation to this feeling, but it is present more often than not. Differences in their character can be strangely easy for them to handle, simply because a Sagittarius takes everything in with ease, and Capricorn feels responsible enough to understand their partner’s immaturity as their own fault, in some strange way.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach Capricorn wants meaning and depth to their physical encounters, for they are slow, thorough and value their physical reality. Sagittarius often doesn’t understand the pace at which a Capricorn wants to move in, nor do they see the importance of the physical world that Capricorn has the responsibility to. In the beginning of their relationship, if they share the same desires, they might not see how incompatible they actually are. Unfortunately, as time passes, it becomes pretty obvious that their archetypal battle reflects on their characters in a way that taints their sex life.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only way they can ever remain in a healthy sexual relationship, is if Sagittarius respects the physical, as much as Capricorn loosens up and respects change that comes with their partner’s Jupiter governed Soul.

Capricorn feels this and recognizes the lack of inner honesty that doesn’t seem to change. The problem here is in the fact that Capricorn is the sign of Jupiter’s fall and this is the ruler of Sagittarius, as well as the traditional ruler of Pisces. The magic of life and the beliefs that lead in a certain direction seem to be lost on Capricorn. They know with certainty that the only things that give results are their rational mind and hard work. How can someone like Sagittarius explain to them that beliefs create their reality and that it is enough to believe in a good outcome, to affect the entire web of circumstances in a positive way? This issue comes down to a problem with trust, but in fact it goes much deeper than that."},"Intellect":{"Value":75,"Description":"A Sagittarius and a Capricorn can be full of understanding for each other, if they don’t jump into a battle over their belief systems. Sagittarius has that optimistic smile that will definitely put a smile on Capricorn’s face too, and it will get much easier for those fiery, creative ideas of Sagittarius to find their grounding through Capricorn’s practical approach. With enough respect, this is a couple that links a visionary with a builder, and there is really nothing they cannot make when together. If they don’t expect change from one another, they are very likely to be extremely intellectually compatible.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most beautiful thing in this contact is in their complementing protective roles. Both of these signs represent protection, Sagittarius ruled by the greatest benefic and Capricorn as our fence, our shell to the outer world.

If they are in search of someone who will not allow interfering, meddling and any type of disrespect from other people, this relationship might be their best choice."},"Emotions":{"Value":55,"Description":"Sagittarius and Capricorn can find a shared emotional language due to the fact that Capricorn needs someone like their opposing sign to complete them, and Sagittarius tends to become that sign as a place of Jupiter’s exaltation. This is where their hearts meet and if there is enough faith in a Sagittarius, without any unrealistic expectations, they might fall in love deeply. There is a small chance that a Sagittarius will be that mellow, tender person a Capricorn needs, but this is something that can be overcome with enough closeness and understanding of their differences."},"Values":{"Value":20,"Description":"There is one important thing these partners agree on, and that is the value of intelligence.

The lack of relationship between their Suns helps their bond with a certain lack of disrespect. This leads them into a situation in which a Sagittarius finds their Capricorn partner interesting, as an extraterrestrial they have always wanted to meet. They are different enough to be interested in each other with genuine curiosity and a Sagittarius is always ready to try out something new. Capricorn will probably refuse many of the childish activities Sagittarius suggests, but it becomes fun to talk them into it and there is a note of laughter and joy in these attempts. They are both smart enough and aware that their differences exist, which makes their entire story so exciting and refreshing for both.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Summary":{"Value":38,"Description":"This is not your ideal relationship, and it will rarely be the one they both choose to stay in for the rest of their lives. Still, their understanding and acceptance of their differences is refreshing and fun for both partners, and they might have a good time while together, for however long. We cannot predict too much stability unless a Capricorn decides to make it, but the smile on Sagittarius’ face and the ability they have to make their partner laugh, can be the pillar of their bond for as long as they both need it."}},"Aquarius":{"Love":{"Value":80,"Description":"Aquarius acts in a way Sagittarius thinks and this is quite an asset in their sex life. Their attraction can be strong, especially when a Sagittarius partner is at a crossroads in their life and need confirmation of their freedom and sexuality. Their sexual relationship will be very fun, because they both like to experiment and learn new things. Their communication will usually give them both so much satisfaction that sometimes they both almost won’t even need the act of sex in order to get satisfied.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough their sexual connection can be very satisfying for both partners, they could have trouble creating intimacy. Sagittarius partner will bring just enough warmth in their relationship, but the mutable quality of their sign will make them easily turn their focus to something else, while Aquarius partner still holds on to the same things. They will both understand the necessity of change and incorporate it in their sex life. Still, the emotional bond and consequentially the intimacy between them could get weak and strong, on and off, too often for both of them to see each other as perfect partners."},"Trust":{"Value":60,"Description":"They will sometimes know each other’s minds too well for them to create trust from the sense of absolute freedom. Sagittarius can be a sign prone to infidelity and Aquarius likes to be free to be available. With them both knowing these things about each other, they could easily start questioning if they should trust one another or not.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough they both find their relationships very dependent on the level of freedom they have, this is probably something they won’t be able to give to each other when they decide to commit to their romantic relationship. The best remedy for the lack of trust in any of the partners is for both of them to realize they their relationship is just something out of the ordinary, casual and free from any restraints."},"Intellect":{"Value":90,"Description":"When Sagittarius and Aquarius find a mutual interest, it becomes the infinite source of new topics, information and could even change their life philosophies. Aquarius partner can remain distant for a long time and Sagittarius might feel like a little child, talking excessively about uninteresting topics and trying to make a connection. When they finally point in the right direction and choose to speak of something that awakens Aquarian interest, their conversations will become incredible.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth of these partners are rational and give a lot of attention to their chain of thoughts. Both of them are fast enough in coming to different conclusions. The contact between them will spark their need for intellectual sparring and they could end up in some great debates. When they share a love for something, they will talk about it passionately, excessively and find new ideas and solutions to incorporate in their approach to this subject. The speed of Aquarius mixed with the passionate state of constant belief of Sagittarius, could make their relationship one of the most productive in the entire zodiac."},"Emotions":{"Value":85,"Description":"It is hard to set the scale for emotions in this relationship. None of these partners is that emotional on the surface, although Sagittarius can fall in and out of love quite often. It is a good thing that Sagittarius is so changeable, or they would have trouble keeping up with their Aquarius partner. Another good thing in this contact is the rational nature of both signs and their focus on mental processes. This will allow them to communicate about their emotions, whatever they are, without any sense of guilt or emotional pressure.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen their emotions start to build, it will take a long time before they are stable and both partners certain of their feelings for each other. Sagittarius will change their mind many times, probably going from one extreme to another because that is what they’re inspired to do by their Aquarius partner. On the other hand, Aquarius will need to form attachment first and then wait for the certainty of their partner’s love."},"Values":{"Value":90,"Description":"There is so many things they would agree on, starting from the usual – value of freedom, and moving on to their own qualities and expectations. They will both value wideness of one’s mind, the optimism and the faith behind the brains, intelligence and vision. As a sign of Neptune’s exaltation, Aquarius has a special approach to honesty, and for a Sagittarius honesty is one of the things they value most."},"Activities":{"Value":85,"Description":"There will be activities that Sagittarius will want to commit to, while Aquarius will find them silly or even stupid. They could have trouble reconciling their approach to religion and any religious activities could be the source of problems in their relationship, because their whole individual belief systems could be at stake. Still, in most situations they could have a lot of fun wherever they go. Sagittarius will easily put on a smile and follow any idea Aquarius has, for as long as it makes sense or they have something to learn from it. There will probably be no place strange enough for these two to discover their shared interests once again."},"Summary":{"Value":83,"Description":"A relationship between a Sagittarius and an Aquarius partner might seem like a same sex friendship to other people and whatever they might think of this, this is the type of relationship both of these partners might need. They will get together when it is time for both of them to go through a change in their lives or leave a partner they feel restricted with. Their relationship is often a shiny beacon to everyone around them because it gives priority to the future and brings hope of a better time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main challenge of Sagittarius and Aquarius lies in their rational natures. Although their minds will have a wonderful relationship, they could have trouble reaching real intimacy and closeness. They both need to slow down and ask themselves how they feel before they end up in a heartless bond they find solace in as they run away from the world."}},"Pisces":{"Love":{"Value":75,"Description":"At first glance, two Pisces representatives might become a perfect couple, but when we scratch beneath the surface, we might see that they have real trouble getting close to each other. Their sex life can be magical, but in many cases they will not even get to the physical contact, keeping their relationship senselessly platonic. This is not a consequence of a lack of initiative, but rather their own need to stay in the bubble of emotional perfection and their fear of bursting this bubble by forming a physical relationship that requires dealing with physical imperfections.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they begin a physical relationship, they could both be too cautious on choices of sexual activity they will suggest to each other. Their relationship might strangely inhibit them both, because of the possibility of unrealistic expectations and the fear of being let down. Fortunately, their mutable natures will in most cases allow them to progress and make enough adaptations and changes for their sex life to work. When they do, they will find the exact amount of tenderness and sexual freedom they both need, and understand each other’s needs before they are spoken."},"Trust":{"Value":50,"Description":"Trust is a very difficult subject when two Pisces representatives begin a romantic relationship. Their main problem is in the fact that they know each other too well. They can both recognize their own unstable and unreliable nature in their partner, so instead of building trust and changing them both for the better, they will easily get caught in a circle of attempts to be honest and dishonest, without the need for their flaky nature to change. The best way for them to create a safe and trustful atmosphere is in a lot of meaningful communication that they both usually find obsolete."},"Intellect":{"Value":60,"Description":"Pisces is the sign of Mercury’s fall and these individuals will often be too closed up or lost to have good practical communication. Although they will share their dreams with one another, and probably inspire each other in many ways, it will be difficult for them to have discussions on ongoing things in their lives. They will both have their own image of what is important for their partner to know about them. It is a good thing they will have such a strong feeling on each other’s point, because they would probably never meet each other at all if there was no emotional connection between them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey will have a tendency not to move from a certain point, both of them intensely focused on the idea of love, rather than actual activities. This will easily lead them to a place where there is really nothing else to share and talk about especially if they don’t share the same group of friends, or have other joined activities that they can discuss on a daily basis. If they lead separate lives, they could end up in a relationship where they simply don’t know each other and crave for closeness with someone else."},"Emotions":{"Value":99,"Description":"Pisces is the sign that exalts Venus, the planet of love. Not only does Venus rule the sign of Libra, speaking of our relationships, but it is also the ruler of Taurus and represents physical pleasures and satisfaction of the physical body. The sign of Pisces has a great responsibility to exalt the planet that is linked to all sides of a loving relationship. Emotional contact between two Pisces partners will rarely materialize, because both partners are in search for someone who needs inspiration, and the two of them don’t need this from their partner.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they fall in love, this is a fairytale romance and their emotional contact is something that no other sign can reach. Two of the representatives of Venus’ exaltation in the same relationship, are love multiplied. Their tenderness and the way they nurture their emotions toward each other, will be a true inspiration for everyone around them. There is no better partner to understand the emotional nature of a Pisces partner, than another Pisces. Their mutable quality will show through emotional changes and apparent inconsistency, but in truth, they will know exactly when to separate and when to be together in order for their love to remain exciting and beautiful.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Values":{"Value":80,"Description":"With their sign exalting Venus, it is difficult to speak about their values while they are in a relationship. They will both value talent, one’s ability to stay true, and the flexibility someone has in the outer world. However, two Pisces partners might realize that they don’t share the same values when they are together. The problem here is in the fact that they are too alike and they will wake each other’s deficiencies through mere existence. This will lead to misunderstandings and the conviction of both partners that they don’t value the same things. Not because their values differ that much, but because their priorities might be different."},"Activities":{"Value":75,"Description":"They will most certainly have a lot of fun. Two Pisces partners cannot ever be bored. Their relationship will be satisfying to all their senses, and they will spend many romantic nights, as well as exciting days, in each other’s arms. That is, if they ever manage to meet. While one of them might appear at the agreed point in time, the other will get lost, miss a turn, or show up at their previous meeting point. When they finally manage to find each other, with many hours of delay, they might move in opposite directions and be unaware of that due to the fact they didn’t talk to begin with. In general, their shared activities are dependent very much on their physical contact, because if they have it, at least they could hold hands not to get lost."},"Summary":{"Value":73,"Description":"This is a relationship of two kindred spirits that often doesn’t last very long. At first, it will be challenging for them to leave the platonic zone and start building a physical relationship. Once they get close to each other, their process of learning will begin and both partners will be fascinated by each other, thinking that their relationship could never end. They will easily idealize each other, think of their relationship as the perfect love, but this infatuation won’t last very long because of their changeable natures. The fact is their relationship represents a moment in time when they have both deserved to smile. For as long as it lasts and they are happy, it will be cherished by both of them.\\r\\n\\r\\n"}}},"Capricorn":{"Aries":{"Love":{"Value":5,"Description":"This is a very difficult combination of signs when it comes to sexual compatibility. Rulers of Aries and Capricorn are Mars and Saturn. These planets are considered archetypal or karmic enemies. When it comes to sexuality, it is mostly signified by Mars and its contact with Saturn may result in all sorts of physical and objective obstacles on the way to a healthy sex life. Saturn puts too much pressure on Mars and takes a lot of its energy. Their relationship will result in lack of sexual desire, the mutual feeling of incompetence or even impotence of one or both included parties.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen this sort of relationship happens, it is in most cases triggered by some deep unconscious need to be held back and restricted when it comes to sexuality. As with everything that comes through the sign of Capricorn, with time Aries partner could achieve some sort of balanced state in which they are sexually satisfied and their instinctive needs are met. Unfortunately, Capricorn partner will lose their energy and the need to participate in this sort of sexual behavior by that time. This will ultimately lead to their separation, for there is nothing light or easy with these two, especially when it comes to intimate matters.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of the unconscious type of their relationship, they could be insanely attracted to each other, but in most cases their differences will keep them at a safe distance. At their best, Capricorn will support Aries’ libido and control their passion to burn as slowly as possible. At the same time, Aries would consider their partner a teacher and learn about their body and the way to satisfy them. Still, this is a balance that is extremely hard to achieve when the clash of these two hard personalities happens."},"Trust":{"Value":99,"Description":"Since they are both in extremes and “all or nothing” types of people, it will be easy for them to trust each other. Even if they have deep misunderstandings in other areas of their relationship, they will rarely betray each other’s trust. This is something they will easily take for granted though, for when they are together, they seem to lose awareness of the things between them that should be treasured. One of them should have the sense to remind the other from time to time about the qualities that their bond includes."},"Intellect":{"Value":20,"Description":"They should keep their conversation in touch with carrier goals, achievements at work and physical activity, for Capricorn exalts Mars, the ruler of Aries. Other than that, they don’t have much to talk about.\\r\\n\\r\\nRarely will a Capricorn partner allow their impulsive and from their perspective even stupid Aries partner to have their own opinions and value them as useful or practical. Although they will certainly respect their initiative and energy level, the rest of Aries behavior is simply unacceptable in most matters. Since Capricorn has their feet on the ground and is capable to measure the situation rationally, they will hold on to their calm opinion about their partner’s lack of tact and endurance or even of their idiotism. You can imagine how annoying this can be to an Aries, especially if you take into consideration their passionate need to set strong boundaries and be respected in every way possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, Aries will simply have no patience for their Capricorn partner. They will seem boring and as if they only want people in their life to be useful. This will be attributed to their selfishness and lack of emotion and heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth of them will be wrong in a way, for they would need to understand what they both could become if the right person or motivator came along. The problem is they could remain stuck in this pointless ego battle, until they both get so tired that they will hardly think of another relationship ever again."},"Emotions":{"Value":1,"Description":"In this special case it would be best not to call this paragraph “emotions”, but “understanding”. Their problem is in the way they understand each other to begin with. At the beginning of their relationship they will both probably have an image of the other person as someone they could become after some effort is put into their growth. The problem is that no one here wants to change. Their emotions could easily be connected to this first image they’ve had, however unrealistic it might be. So this is exactly what we would call the lack of understanding, because these two could be crazy in love with each other’s false image and crazy persistent to change one another.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir problem really isn’t the lack of emotion to each other (although you could easily contribute their issues to emotional disability considering their Mars/Saturn nature), but the lack of understanding and acceptance of each other. They are often too stubborn and narrow minded to see that there is something different than what fits into their boundaries of possible personal characteristics.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Values":{"Value":60,"Description":"They both value independence, clarity and honesty, and in general their system of values is not what brings problems to their relationship. Mostly they are in sync when it comes to serious view of people they are surrounded with. The problem they have is in their unrealistic expectations founded on the fact that they share some values.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Aries values someone’s ability to endure and push themselves over all possible personal barriers, that doesn’t mean they are ready to become this person, or have the control to be one. Similarly, Capricorn might value speed and focus of some people, but this doesn’t mean they will jeopardize their depth or attention to detail just to be faster, or leave deep psychological needs unattended only to stay focused at some goal."},"Activities":{"Value":40,"Description":"Capricorn sometimes just doesn’t understand why Aries wants to run at 6 in the morning. Aries doesn’t understand why Capricorn would spend all night doing something extremely boring, just to be thorough when it has no value in this particular matter. What Aries doesn’t understand is that studiousness always has its value, as much as Capricorn doesn’t understand the physical need of their body to rest and act on impulse from time to time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey can easily find activities they both like when they include physical movement. They both need to pay attention to their bodies and everyday habits, so it would be good for them to have the same physical activity every day at the same time together. This way they would motivate each other – Aries will lift up Capricorn’s energy and Capricorn would give endurance to their shared efforts. This could do wonders for their entire relationship, for they could understand each other’s natures much better through this sort of basic activity."},"Summary":{"Value":38,"Description":"This is not an easy relationship. None of the partners has any trace of lightness and blissful ignorance. This is why their relationship might seem like a competition to ruin the relationship in the best possible way. It is hard to say who will get out of it a winner, for they will both feel lousy most of the time and be relieved that they finally separated. If they stubbornly decide they love each other too much to let each other go, both of them would probably bang their heads against a wall for years to come.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir only chance of success is unconditional respect and the wideness of their views and expectations. They could truly complement each other, but only in a scenario where they would look for good in one another and highlight each other’s qualities. Unfortunately, the malefic nature of their rulers rarely allows for them to be this positive and acceptance oriented. If they got together, and whatever their story is, they should think about the things they could learn from each other instead of looking for each other’s shortcomings, and always stay out of each other’s business."}},"Taurus":{"Love":{"Value":85,"Description":"Taurus and Capricorn can both be quite rigid when it comes to sex. This is exactly what could make them a perfect couple. In combination with other signs of the zodiac it can be hard for them to open up and feel the need to experiment, even though Capricorn will do their best to show how ingenious they are when it comes to sex. When they get together and get to know each other intimately, they will learn what it means to relax. Capricorn won’t feel the need to show off and Taurus will let go of their fear of getting hurt.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem in their relationship can be hidden in their understanding of the Moon, for Taurus exalts it, and Capricorn doesn’t like it very much. They could have trouble connecting on an emotional level if Capricorn doesn’t fall in love deeply enough or has trust issues. This will be multiplied by Taurus’ need to be loved unconditionally that they show in an endless loop, scaring their Capricorn away.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir different approaches to the combination of sexual instincts and love are what could make a gap between them. Taurus has a problem with initiative and aggression, not understanding Mars that well, while Capricorn needs initiative, physical strength and supports Mars. In their sex life, this could lead to a lack of emotion from Capricorn partner, leading to the frustration of Taurus, scared away by their libido with no emotional foundation. This could go as far as impotence and a general lack of sexual desire in both partners, unless they hold on to intimate nature of their sexuality and approach each other as different individuals with certain needs."},"Trust":{"Value":99,"Description":"Capricorn just isn’t into lying. They don’t even judge it but find it unnecessary and stupid. Even when they do tell a lie, in most cases it is an experiment with other human beings to see if they can guess where the truth lies. When they are intimately involved, they like things between them and their partner clean and true. Taurus can easily sense this and will feel secure enough to not give in to their occasional need to hide things from their partner. Taurus is ruled by Venus, a planet exalted in the sign of Pisces, so they have this understanding of importance of secrecy when they are in love. With Capricorn, they can find a way to hide their intimacy from the rest of the world and stay true to their loved one for a very, very long time."},"Intellect":{"Value":85,"Description":"Although they have different natures, they understand each other very well and motivate each other to grow – each of them in their needed direction. Their differences are exactly there to make them a perfect couple, because they complement each other in a more subtle way then their opposing signs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe deep understanding of the Moon is something Taurus is blessed with and Capricorn lacks in their core. The fear of emotion can easily become a daily routine of neglect toward their personal emotional needs. Taurus has a mission to teach Capricorn about the significance of tenderness one should always have for one self. In return, Capricorn will help Taurus deal with responsibility and teach them how to reach their goals with no distracting emotions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not always easy for them to understand each other, but with enough compassion and openness to feel for the other person, they can support each other in a way no other pair of signs can. After all, they do belong to the element of Earth, and can make magic in our material reality when they reconcile their differences."},"Emotions":{"Value":90,"Description":"It is difficult to say with certainty they will find emotional fulfillment with each other because they are both very careful when it comes to love. This is usually something like a pattern to be broken when they do begin a relationship, for they have enough time and patience for one another. From the perspective of Taurus, this might not be the best emotional contact they’ve ever had, but from Capricorn’s perspective, things can’t get much better than being loved by a Taurus partner.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, there is a dose of almost unbearable satisfaction Taurus will feel when their long-term digging reaches the emotional core of their Capricorn partner. When this contact is reached, they will rarely feel the need to separate from them again. To Capricorn this may seem as if someone literally touched their heart and they will probably never want to let their Taurus partner go.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Values":{"Value":90,"Description":"With shared sense for value of the material world, these two can get really far together. While Taurus would create and motivate, Capricorn would lead the way to success and financial security. Whatever their goals, they could easily reach them together due to the fact they share the same material values to begin with. Still, they don’t have such a peachy situation when it comes to their approach to emotions and family. They should observe different sides of their personalities as complementing instead of destructive and find a way to coexist giving value to each other’s shadow.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Activities":{"Value":85,"Description":"You could say that Taurus is lazy and Capricorn never stops working, but this is not exactly the case. If any sign in the zodiac needs rest, it would be Capricorn. Their high ambition can lead them to a state of low energy and Taurus is there to mend their tired Soul with fine food and time for joy. On the other hand, if the creative, motivating side of Taurus is awaken by the striving nature of their Capricorn partner, they will become everything but lazy and make room for both of them to be satisfied and happy with what they’ve accomplished. In short, they can do anything together, for as long as they hold on to a fine balance of activity and rest.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Summary":{"Value":89,"Description":"Taurus and Capricorn can form a relationship so deep that their creative power in the material realm could seem unreachable for other signs of the zodiac. With the ability to complement each other in a gentle, slow way, they are the most boring couple on the outside, with most exciting inner activity that stays hidden from the rest of the world. If Taurus motivates their Capricorn partner, and Capricorn shows the way of accomplishment to their Taurus partner, they could work together, raise children and share a life with more fun than they are both used to, or simply form an unbreakable bond. When their deep emotions intertwine, they are bound to each other for eternity."}},"Gemini":{"Love":{"Value":1,"Description":"There are certain activities that don’t require many words, and in Capricorn’s humble opinion sex is one of them. Then Gemini comes along and starts explaining each position, the interesting overview on Kama Sutra and the beauty of outdoor sex. It is almost unbearable to watch these partners with their completely different philosophies while they try to maneuver their sex life.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order for Capricorn to experiment in sex, their partner needs to manage to really relax them and open their mind. With Gemini, they feel like taking care of a child heading for trouble, getting naked wherever they feel like it. Although this is not actually the case, this is how it may seem to Capricorn, reliant on traditional values and always taking responsibility for their actions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn most cases, they will hardly even be attracted to one another. If they become sexual partners, there is a big chance that Gemini will find their Capricorn partner uncreative and stiff, while Capricorn would think of Gemini as too unconventional. The strangest thing in this combination of the signs is in the fact they will both probably consider each other boring. Yes, everyone would say Capricorn can be boring and Gemini is so interesting and fun, but actually, the lack of focus and deep feelings Gemini partner usually suffers from, is a huge turn off for Capricorn. All things considered, these two are not actually the best sexual partners among the zodiac signs, but could make a meeting point in a relationship with enough boundaries and enough creativity of both partners."},"Trust":{"Value":50,"Description":"A typical Capricorn representative will not be easily tricked. Gemini partner can have a tendency to flirt a lot and to consider “light adultery” normal. This is thinking of a crazy person in the opinion of a Capricorn, and there are no “levels” of adultery in their world. What’s clear is clear. Still, because of Capricorn’s trust equation that makes their life easy, they will tend to trust their Gemini. Actually, they will trust their own interpretation of what Gemini says.\\r\\n\\r\\nCapricorn always goes one step deeper than others, and Gemini rarely puts that much thought into their alibies. This is why Capricorn will read them with so much ease, probably knowing exactly where they’ve been and what they are dishonest about. Gemini, on the other hand, will find Capricorn so square and by the book, that they won’t even doubt their faithfulness and honesty, even if they have something to hide."},"Intellect":{"Value":25,"Description":"It is safe to say that Gemini can talk to anyone and settle any issue by communicating. Unfortunately, this doesn’t mean a lot to a Capricorn when they recognize the lack of essence in the things their partner says. However, they will still have a lot to talk about because there is always that serious side to Gemini in one of their personalities that will have a thing or two to share with a strict and sometimes difficult Capricorn.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a good thing that Gemini are interested in literally everything that exists in the world and outside of it. So if nothing else works, they can always talk about Space Stations, diamond stars and other galaxies. Capricorn is interested in things that have deep, hidden meaning, looking at them as equations that should be solved and admiring problem solvers. They could spend their life in this strange analysis that is not so much focused on details as maybe Virgo’s would be, but on the bridge between different worlds. Capricorn is fascinated by the before and after logic behind every little thing, and this is where Gemini can help them set a list to investigate.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they are at peace and don’t look at each other as stupid, distant or boring, they could help one another build a better understanding for the world. Capricorn’s steady, secure nature could teach Gemini how to make schedules and organize their thoughts and their actions, giving them a chance to move each thought a step further. In return, Gemini’s childish approach to life can be something wonderful for Capricorn to incorporate in their life in order to be happier."},"Emotions":{"Value":1,"Description":"Ruled by Mercury and Saturn, both signs are not that emotional, but the real problem is in the fact that they usually don’t even spark some emotions in one another. Although both of them can have relationships with other not-so-emotional signs in which they feel awakened with their partner, when they are with each other, they can be immune to each other’s charm. There is just not that much to connect them and mostly their emotional relationship comes down to Gemini’s dark thoughts and Capricorn’s emotional distance."},"Values":{"Value":5,"Description":"Gemini truly values information in any form and shape, someone’s ability to talk beautifully, to creatively use their hands and to implement ideas with a higher purpose. Capricorn values stability, punctuality and plain honesty. Although they will both be dazzled by the independence of their partner, the rest of their worlds rarely coincide that much."},"Activities":{"Value":10,"Description":"They would both walk a lot, that’s true, but the divergence of their motives is almost unbelievable. Capricorn is a sign of useful things, and they will want to have useful activity, whatever it may be. If they do go for a walk, they will want to do this in order to get from point A to point B, or to have a healthier lifestyle. When Gemini walks, they never know where they’ll end up. They might have started their route on the way to the supermarket, but one telephone call later, they are already in their car, heading to a different city. It is a good thing that Gemini always wants to learn new things and Capricorn likes routine and dedication, so they have a strong base for constructive studying and problem solving. However, in most cases, their roads go in different directions."},"Summary":{"Value":15,"Description":"Gemini and Capricorn partners are a very strange fit. Although they are both looking for things the other person has, they don’t seem to recognize them in each other. While Gemini needs someone to ground them and give them depth, when they look at Capricorn, they see someone old, unmovable and boring. Capricorn needs joy and relaxation in their life, but Gemini seems like a ball of uncontrollable, superficial opinions heading nowhere. In truth, they could have a valuable experience being together, sharing their different lives day after day. They might even find out that they actually work well together and have the ability to reach any goal that they think of."}},"Cancer":{"Love":{"Value":99,"Description":"Cancer and Capricorn are opposing signs and there is a strong attraction between them. When they get together, a passion awakens and they both become perfect lovers for one another. The patience Capricorn has for their partner is something Cancer really needs to relax and start feeling sexual to begin with. Capricorn needs someone who acts on true emotion, but also someone who doesn’t take sex lightly. There are Capricorn representatives who have changed many partners, but they will probably never stay with the one that isn’t family oriented and emotional when it comes to physical relations.\\r\\n\\r\\nIntimacy Cancer can create is exactly compatible to what Capricorn lacks. There is a lack of love, home and warmth in the sign of Capricorn, and Cancer partner can heal this with their highly compassionate approach. This could lead to thawing of Capricorn’s emotional state and uplift the state of their sex life significantly."},"Trust":{"Value":99,"Description":"Although Capricorn might seem trustful, they are probably one of the least trusting signs of the zodiac. Not only is the sign of Pisces in their third house representing the way they think, but they are also often led by panic in their intimate relationships. When a Capricorn representative falls in love, they will understand that their partner needs to see trust and this is what they’ll show. However, they could have trouble believing anything their partner says until some consistency is proven or their stories checked out with other people.\\r\\n\\r\\nLuckily, in Cancer’s world there is often nothing that ugly and secretive to find, for their moral values are as high as the exaltation of Jupiter in their sign. For as long as Cancer feels Capricorn’s devotion, they will not question their actions. This is why Cancer could easily sense their partner’s lack of trust, pretend that they didn’t notice, and find it endearing rather than repulsive."},"Intellect":{"Value":70,"Description":"This is a couple that has the strangest thing in common – genetics. Not literally, of course, but they often share their image of a relationship their distant relatives had, maybe centuries ago. There is information in our emotional body, about each emotion our ancestors have felt and didn’t know how to deal with or how to use. This is where Cancer and Capricorn connect, as signs of the family we come from, and the family we will create.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese partners could feel like they have known each other before they’ve actually met. Their mutual affection will seem familiar and warm, as if they grew up in a same house, even though their circumstances might be completely different. This could make them able to talk about anything, for there is closeness to the relationship of these two signs that is unexplainable to all others.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, if this emotional bonding doesn’t come at first impulse, Capricorn could be very difficult to talk to from Cancer’s perspective. They need to connect on a very deep level, or they will have opposite goals and Capricorn could seem like a career obsessed lunatic with no emotion what so ever, while Cancer could seem like a clingy housewife (no matter if male or female). They should both remember that if they see each other in this negative light, they are probably only hiding from their own, inner opposite side, dismissing the chance to be complete."},"Emotions":{"Value":75,"Description":"Cancer and Capricorn are a love story their ancestors had, waiting to be resolved. Although this could sound like a dream come true and could in fact create very strong emotions in both partners, there is almost always a karmic debt to be repaid before they could say they are truly happy together. These signs represent the axis of Jupiter’s exaltation and fall and it is important to understand that their emotional states are closely linked to their expectations from each other and their relationship.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese two are considered one of the most and one of the least emotional signs of the zodiac. One of them should be family oriented and the other turned to their career. Still, their emotions often run wild as soon as they lay eyes on each other. In time, they will both fight for security and stability of their relationship, and although it might be hard for them to reconcile these primal emotional differences, they will in most cases simply – find a way.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe emotional depth of Capricorn is really hard to reach, but Cancer partner can approach this as their life challenge. When they get tied to each other, it is almost impossible for them not to get married, have children and the entire earthly love package. Still, they could take so much of each other’s energy if they tried to change each other. It is best for them to accept each other’s personalities as inevitable and impossible to change. This could lead to a more sensible future than the one in which they are both simply tired of each other."},"Values":{"Value":70,"Description":"They both value stability and practical sense. As opposing signs, they can seem to have opposing values, but this is not really the case. They both need stability in their lives and will value people who give them the sense of security. This is probably something they will value most in each other, the ability of both not to quit or give up, however hard things might get."},"Activities":{"Value":90,"Description":"Cancer is not very picky when it comes to activity choices their partner has, for as long as they are not imposed on them or too aggressive for their taste. Capricorn is careful and will plan their activities well in advance, so both of them will have time to adjust to the idea or change their minds if they realize that this is not what they want. It will be very easy for them to agree on what they want to do together and find such activities, only if they respect each other’s personalities. Capricorn will not want to go shopping for house decorations, no more than Cancer will want to go three nights without sleep just because of a project at work. If they respect each other’s boundaries, their time spent together should be truly satisfying for both.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Summary":{"Value":84,"Description":"Cancer and Capricorn are usually bound to relive the love story of someone who lived before their time. This deeply seeded need to mend what is broken in our family tree is something we all carry within, but these Sun signs are predestined to handle karmic debts and residue emotions from their families. They will have to deal with problems first if they want to be free of the past, and only after they have repaid what needed to be repaid, will they be able to truly choose one another. In most cases this is a once in a lifetime love for both partners, and they will probably choose each other without a doubt."}},"Leo":{"Love":{"Value":5,"Description":"Leo and Capricorn have one thing in common and it is their awareness of their Selves. It will be a rare occasion when Leo is attracted to a Capricorn, but the other way around attraction seems more probable. However, they won’t often get to the sexual part of their relationship, for even though they both might enjoy the chase, they will not see their future together.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeo is a warm, passionate sign, and Capricorn likes to be coolheaded and practical. This doesn’t mean that Leo isn’t at all practical, or that Capricorn isn’t passionate, but they won’t see each other as similar in any way. The rulers of these signs represent one of the archetypal conflicts of the zodiac, and tell the story of the fallen ego. This need could easily pull them both in a direction which will endanger their self-esteems and affect the image they have on their beauty and attractiveness. This is usually ignited by Leo’s freedom of sexual expression that Capricorn fears, leading to the insecurity in both partners because they are not able to fit into each other’s set of expectations.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir sex life can easily become boring for both partners, and what they often don’t realize is how similar they actually are. The only way for them to have a healthy sex life is to share warmth and always bring new experiences, spicing things up. If they find themselves in a rut, they might stay there for a very long time, leading to the loss of libido and confidence, up to a loss of any sexual desire."},"Trust":{"Value":40,"Description":"Capricorn knows that Neptune falls in Leo. This is exactly why they also know what hides behind the act in their Leo partner. The depth Capricorn is prepared to go to makes Leo partner question their own motives and their whole personality. Lies seem to be impossible in this relationship, for each lied told, comes right back. As much as Capricorn sees behind the shine of Leo, Leo shines a light on Capricorn’s darkness. Nothing stays hidden for long and as soon as one of them tries to stay secretive, mistrust is awaken. However, in many situations they tend to trust each other because it gets so obvious that there is no reason not to."},"Intellect":{"Value":60,"Description":"Their priorities differ greatly, and they both have a strong set of personal priorities in their lives. This is something that will not be easily reconciled and these partners could spend too much time trying to prove to one another why each of them has a point on what comes first. The problem is in the lack of understanding that each one of them has their own mission and their own role. It is futile to insist on someone’s priorities changed when they should be different to begin with.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they respect each other enough to accept some pretty big differences, their communication might be very satisfying and fulfilling for both of them. Leo will help Capricorn find a more positive and creative view on every situation and Capricorn will give Leo the depth and the serious intentions they need. When they combine their abilities to organize, any plan made could be perfect."},"Emotions":{"Value":1,"Description":"A relationship between a Leo and a Capricorn partner can be truly emotionally challenging, not because they don’t love each other, but because they do. Warm emotions of Leo are easily cooled down and buried, and without the ability to express love, Leo can become pretty depressed. In return, the time Capricorn needs to build the emotional story they need, will be roughly interrupted by their fiery Leo partner. This could hurt them, or lead them to the opinion that Leo is not the right person for them, however attractive, smart, capable or beautiful they might be.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem with this couple is in the way they build up emotions, and their best chances are in time and patience, things that Leo rarely possesses, and Capricorn rules. There is no other way to reach the heart of a Capricorn partner and discover that they can be warm too. If there has been too much pain in their prior emotional relationships, both partners could be almost too stubborn to get to the point where they might actually fall in love."},"Values":{"Value":50,"Description":"Leo and Capricorn both value well organized people, presentations and plans. Leo is not much of a plan maker, they would rather go with the flow and look only a couple of days in advance, and they respect Capricorn’s ability to focus on the final destination and weigh every step of the way. Still, the sensitive, calm, emotional center that Capricorn values is never found in a Leo and unless they are truly inspired by their Leo partner, they could take away their worth just because of preferences. Leo values direct, open hearted people with big smiles, and as soon as they judge Capricorn for not smiling all the time, they might as well end the relationship."},"Activities":{"Value":5,"Description":"Activities these partners might share depend greatly on their priorities, once again. If Leo wants to settle down, they might find it interesting to spend time in a usual, Capricorn way. In return, if Capricorn needs some additional energy and vigor, they will gladly follow Leo in their chosen activities. The most important thing in their relationship is good timing. If it doesn’t exist, they will simply resist, stubbornly, doing anything the other person wants to do."},"Summary":{"Value":27,"Description":"If they meet in the right moment, Leo and Capricorn might get along very well. The main problem in their relationship is the set of priorities they might not share, and the passion or determination that both of them have. It is not an easy job, reconciling Saturn with the Sun, but it brings great benefits when it is done. The structure Leo could get and the creativity they might build on together could lift them to exactly what they desired, however their relationship might end. They differ as much as the Earth and the Fire, but when they share a common goal, they are unstoppable.\\r\\n\\r\\n"}},"Virgo":{"Love":{"Value":65,"Description":"A sexual connection between a Virgo and a Capricorn might be great if they both weren’t so stiff and strict when it comes to sex. Even though they don’t lack the patience or the understanding for each other, there always seems to be just that one shred of pure emotion missing in their contact. Very often these partners don’t get to have sex, because they will have more reason not to, than to give in.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe beauty of their sex life, when they manage to synchronize, is in the depth both partners are capable of, that directly links to the depth of emotions they will show through the act of sex. Their main goal is to find someone who doesn’t take sex lightly, someone who is not superficial toward them and cherishes them as they should be cherished. There is a certain shyness to both of them, and this is something that will make them go crazy for one another, if they only reach the point behind the rational distance they normally share.\\r\\n\\r\\nVirgo will bring enough change to their sex life, as a mutable sign, ready to experiment with someone who is so reliable and respectful. This is a perfect relationship for both partners to relax and try out new things, if they find a way to open up in the beginning."},"Trust":{"Value":99,"Description":"Capricorn is a sign that can be trusted, and Earth signs understand this best. There is nothing shady about them, nothing unreliable or quick to turn to deceit. Virgo usually has no reason to be unfaithful, except when they suffer from their own lack of faith and emotion that cannot be controlled. Even if this is the case, a Capricorn partner will inspire them to be the best they can be, and as faithful as possible. They will need some time to get used to each other’s habits and build the trust they both wish for. When they do, they will rarely break it for anyone or anything else.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Intellect":{"Value":90,"Description":"When someone from the Air or the Fire realm observes these two as they talk, this conversation might seem extremely boring. The flow between Earth signs in its clearest form is sometimes unbearable for other zodiac signs and this is something Virgo and Capricorn truly enjoy. The depth of mind in both of these signs will fascinate them at first, excite them and make their communication incredibly interesting and informative. They both like a good, respectful debate, and in each other, they can find a perfect adversary.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are signs that make one cycle of communication complete, Virgo deciding what’s next to discuss and Capricorn deciding when the subject is resolved. They are like a perfect mechanism, like gears fitting in together to solve any equation the world has to give. Their passion lies within these roles and when they find an understanding in other areas of their relationship, the intellectual one can be stimulating to the point of absolute bliss. This is a couple who knows that any problem is there to be solved and anything broken is there to be fixed."},"Emotions":{"Value":65,"Description":"Both of these signs are considered unemotional. Virgo brings Venus to its fall and Capricorn is the sign of the Moon’s detriment. They do have some emotional issues, but not the same ones, and this helps them find an approach to each other that they both understand. Their relationship needs time, most of all, and the emotions between them need to build, just like trust. With the calm, practical, physical passion rising between them, both partners start building their confidence. With confidence, they feel much more liberated to experiment in life and sex, and this gives true quality to all of the areas of their relationship.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most incredible thing this couple shares is their discovery of one another. In time, they will peel layer by layer from each other’s hearts, and be more and more fascinated by what none of them noticed before. Just like a mathematical equation, they represent a mystery box to each another, and they need to open it, bow by bow, side by side, until they unravel the treasure hidden inside it.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Values":{"Value":80,"Description":"Both Virgo and Capricorn will value calm, rational behavior and choices, and one’s ability to remain smart however unbearable the situation might be. They value depth and this is something they will find incredibly soothing in one another, for they will both feel like they don’t need to pretend to be shallow anymore. They will both value practicality, grounding, money and rational investments. The main difference they have to resolve here is in the value of Capricorn’s goals, for they might be ready to do too much from Virgo’s point of view, in order to reach them. In return, Capricorn doesn’t understand Virgo’s lack of motivation and their lack of need to claim the leading position."},"Activities":{"Value":65,"Description":"Where Capricorn wants to go up, Virgo wants to go forward. Even though they are both Earth signs and this will allow them to follow each other with the same energy, they don’t connect that well on the choice of places they want to visit. They will both want to go to a history museum and learn a lot of information there, but Capricorn often doesn’t want to deal with doctors, let alone the calorie counting and green tea. There is no other sign to understand Virgo’s need to sacrifice better than Capricorn, but if they don’t feel responsible for their partner’s activities, they will rarely follow them to depression. The most important thing to do here is hold on to positive activities and to a routine that makes them both healthy and happy."},"Summary":{"Value":77,"Description":"Virgo and Capricorn belong to the element of Earth and follow each other’s pace perfectly. Even if everything between them seems too slow for some other zodiac signs, they build respect, trust and love, on the foundation of mutual analysis and detailed examination. The search for perfection can be ended in this relationship, for they give each other enough time, and listen to each other well enough to meet the expectations that need to be met. Both of these partners can be stiff and lose sight of the importance of the emotional, mellow approach to life, and this relationship can make them rough and too strict. Still, in most cases, they will give each other enough time to grow out of this and grow old together."}},"Libra":{"Love":{"Value":15,"Description":"When we are speaking of a sexual relationship between a Libra and a Capricorn, the first thing that comes to mind is waiting. Ruled by Venus and Saturn, they tell the tale of a soldier that had to leave his wife and came back after years of waiting. When it comes to sex, this is a combination that could point to a lack of sexual activity, even though both of these signs find sex extremely important in their lives. To begin with, they might feel no attraction at all, and even start a relationship on a basis formed in friendship, only to realize that there is no chemistry between them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf lack of attraction doesn’t stop them, usually something else will. It is a combination that gives in to outer circumstances and things that are out of their control. Both of them could feel pressured and their self-esteem could suffer greatly. Still, there is an understanding between them ignited by Saturn’s exaltation in Libra. This makes them both understand good timing and usually won’t allow them to make a mistake expecting what should not be expected. In case they overcome all of the obstacles and form a strong bond through their personal natal positions, Libra and Capricorn can have sexual relations that are pretty conservative, routinely approached, and only satisfying if they both let go of their strict premises and conditions."},"Trust":{"Value":80,"Description":"A strange thing in a relationship of Libra and Capricorn is a really high level of trust between them. Even though Libra can sometimes have questionable motives, a Capricorn partner will make them turn to Saturn completely and feel guilty at the smallest glimpse of a possible lie. The only possible problem surfaces when Capricorn is too strict from the start, making their Libra partner feel inadequate, judged, or even scared of the consequences of their actions. This could make their relationship dishonest, not because there is actually something to hide, but because Libra partner feels the need to protect themselves by holding on to their privacy."},"Intellect":{"Value":35,"Description":"We wouldn’t say that Libra is that stubborn, but when they find themselves in a relationship with a Capricorn, they suddenly become headstrong and sometimes even impossible to talk to. Even though Libra loves Capricorn because of Saturn’s exaltation, this is shown in the most unusual way, for they seem to feel the need to speak out of spite. This can be a long battle, with no winners or losers, simply two people always building walls between each other, for reasons that aren’t clear to anyone around them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe biggest obstacles to their understanding are the elements they belong to. Air and Earth are too far apart and it seems unclear to these partners how to reach each other on any issue in life. Still, there is a prudence to both of them that might give them just enough depth and understanding to have very interesting discussions and motivate each other to build a better foundation for every next debate. If they remain rational in their mental relations, they could have a lot of fun that other signs wouldn’t be able to understand.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe satisfaction they will both get from serious problem solving might lead them to a point where they find a solution together, Libra puts it in words and Capricorn puts it in action. There is probably nothing in the world that could raise their egos higher than situations in which they managed to resolve something by a simple shared effort.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Emotions":{"Value":1,"Description":"The hardest thing to reconcile in the relationship between a Libra and a Capricorn, are the ways they approach their feelings. Libra is a sign ruled by Venus and their emotions come naturally, but usually restricted and held back due to the seriousness of their nature and the judgment of others they fear. Capricorn has a mission in life to accept all emotion, and in most cases, unless enlightened, they will be this judgmental force that holds Libra down. As if this wasn’t enough, the entire situation will feed Capricorn’s ego and make them think they are right about their approach, leading them further away from their focus point.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a couple that has to work hard on finding a shared language to show how they feel and still respect each other. The emotional nature of Capricorn makes them distant for many, but completely untouchable for Libra as soon as they start dismissing their feelings. The only thing that can be done here is find a point of absolute respect and acceptance of all emotions and their manifestations. If they allow each other to break things, get angry, cry, make scenes in public or give in to hysteria, they might find a way to express their love in a way that will be correctly understood.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Values":{"Value":50,"Description":"The most important values Libra and Capricorn share are the value of time and taking responsibility. This can help them overcome any differences and opposing attitudes, values or convictions, for each of these partners will be ready to understand the set of responsibilities they have toward each other. As Air and Earth signs, both pretty set in their ways, Libra and Capricorn will differ greatly in the value of words and deeds. Libra will communicate and think that their mind is their biggest asset, while Capricorn won’t really care if results aren’t manifested through the material world. This is a good training for a Libra partner to find grounding, but it usually won’t be pleasant for any of them in a romantic relationship."},"Activities":{"Value":25,"Description":"The best thing these two can do together is be boring to the rest of the world. There is a great chance they will be lulled by their relationship to the state of hard work and lazy rest, with no effort for anything creative or inspiring. They need to keep their passions lit and create a weekly routine that will make them get out of the house and do something fun.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Summary":{"Value":34,"Description":"If we want to choose the best word to describe the relationship between a Libra and a Capricorn partner, we would have to say – hard. This doesn’t mean they won’t enjoy the trouble of being together, or stay in a relationship for a very long time, but this is most certainly not a bond that many other signs would engage in. Their biggest challenge is the lack of respect for emotional value that is usually initiated by Capricorn, but easily continued by Libra. If they find a way to share, show and understand each other’s emotions, everything else will seem like a piece of cake."}},"Scorpio":{"Love":{"Value":60,"Description":"Scorpio and Capricorn share a special sexual bond as signs in sextile with each other and due to the fact that Capricorn exalts one of Scorpio’s rulers, Mars. The physical nature of Capricorn will help Scorpio ground their sexual needs with ease. The main problem of this couple is their relationship to the Moon, for they are signs of its fall and detriment. This “agreement” not to be too sensitive and emotional, can take out any real intimacy from their sex life, and make them too cold and distant, even though physically enjoying their relationship. They might even think that this is all they need, but their hearts won’t agree, and other people will show up in their lives that show them how much they actually depend on intimacy.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth of these signs feel a gravitational pull toward their opposing signs, Taurus and Cancer, two of the most emotional signs of the zodiac. This explains their need to build real intimacy. For both of them, physical pleasure has to be achieved through tenderness and emotion, or they won’t truly be satisfied.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general, Scorpio exalts Uranus, and they might be a bit frustrated by the conservative approach of Capricorn. It is a good thing they can wait and slowly build up an atmosphere in which their Capricorn partner will be relaxed enough to try new things and experiment. The excitement of this sexual contact is something Capricorn will have trouble letting go. Scorpio, on the other hand, will enjoy the sense of security and patience they get from their partner, even if they openly express their sexuality."},"Trust":{"Value":90,"Description":"If there is a sign Scorpio can trust, it is the sign of Capricorn. Even though Capricorn representatives don’t have to be that honest at all, their relationship with this direct and honest partner will make them feel like they should be as honest as possible too. Any lack of trust in their relationship is a consequence of the lack of intimacy, for they seem to lack the ability to sense each other deep enough to understand if they do trust one another or not. This can be solved if each partner deals with their own insecurities individually and with an emotional effort to build intimacy.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Intellect":{"Value":70,"Description":"Fixed, unmovable Scorpio, in the state of constant metamorphosis and evolution in the same direction, can be a bite “too big to chew” for their stubborn, earthly, long lasting in everything Capricorn. Their similar pace and the patience Capricorn has, followed by the feel of Scorpio can help their understanding very much, but when they disagree on something, they could end up in a silent fight for years to come.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is nothing light or easy in this interaction, and even though they understand each other’s depth of mind and a certain “what goes around comes around” view on life, they will rarely laugh, dance, and have fun together. They might think that this is not even something they need, but everyone needs to have some fun and smile, or life loses a lot of its meaning. Dark humor might savor their situation, day after day, and if they have the same friends it will be much easier for them to enjoy life together. All friendships Scorpio makes, become long-term with the help of Capricorn when respected enough, and this could help them build a wonderful surrounding full of understanding people who love them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general, they get each other’s need for silence and patiently approach each other until each of them opens up. This can open the door for a respectful communication and intellectual understanding that lasts for a very long time, if they learn to control all the negative convictions that surface when they are together."},"Emotions":{"Value":35,"Description":"The biggest problem in a relationship between a Scorpio and a Capricorn is their emotional contact, simply because they both tend to have emotional problems, dismissing how they feel by dismissing the Moon. When they start their relationship, they will both give the impression of people who stand with their feet firmly on the ground, strong and rough when needed. They will rarely notice that this brings out the expectation to always be the strong person who they were in the beginning, and making them force things on themselves they are not ready for only to avoid showing any weakness. A lot of deep, emotional understanding is needed for them not to be forced to move even further from their life goal to find emotional balance."},"Values":{"Value":30,"Description":"It is truly interesting to watch this couple share values with such a difficult relation to Venus and the term of value itself. Scorpio is the sign of Venus’ detriment and Capricorn brings a lot of guilt into it, so their combination of values is basically founded on feelings of guilt and the sense that nothing is ever good enough. Even though this will be a good motivation for them to get better, every day, it is quite difficult to deal with in a healthy, loving relationship in which they should both discover they are good enough.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Activities":{"Value":99,"Description":"Together, Scorpio and Capricorn will strive for greatness. They will focus their energy on constructive things in order to build the world they wish for themselves. This is not always the most happy, joyful place with rainbows and unicorns, but it is realistic, practical and most of all good for personal growth. If they start digging into the past, they might find shared therapy revealing, even if they don’t need it for any obvious reasons. There is a need in them to dig out the truth, whatever it might be, and this will make it easy for them to spend quality time together without much doubt on what they want to do."},"Summary":{"Value":64,"Description":"The relationship of Scorpio and Capricorn can be inspiring for both partners to search for the truth, dig up under their family tree and deal with any unresolved karma and debt. They are both deep and don’t take things lightly, and this will help them build a strong foundation for a relationship that can last for a long time. However, this exact thing can easily make their relationship too dark and unemotional, pull them both in a state of sadness and depression, or simply awaken their need to search for the light with someone else."}},"Sagittarius":{"Love":{"Value":5,"Description":"There is something unbearable about the sexual contact of these partners. Even when they are attracted to each other and form a sexual bond, after their time has passed they will probably feel like they shouldn’t have been together. There is no logical explanation to this feeling, but it is present more often than not. Differences in their character can be strangely easy for them to handle, simply because a Sagittarius takes everything in with ease, and Capricorn feels responsible enough to understand their partner’s immaturity as their own fault, in some strange way.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach Capricorn wants meaning and depth to their physical encounters, for they are slow, thorough and value their physical reality. Sagittarius often doesn’t understand the pace at which a Capricorn wants to move in, nor do they see the importance of the physical world that Capricorn has the responsibility to. In the beginning of their relationship, if they share the same desires, they might not see how incompatible they actually are. Unfortunately, as time passes, it becomes pretty obvious that their archetypal battle reflects on their characters in a way that taints their sex life.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only way they can ever remain in a healthy sexual relationship, is if Sagittarius respects the physical, as much as Capricorn loosens up and respects change that comes with their partner’s Jupiter governed Soul. Their meeting point is in the sing opposing Capricorn, where the ruler of Sagittarius is exalted. In other words, their meeting point is in pure emotion.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Trust":{"Value":10,"Description":"It is true that Sagittarius is one of the most honest members of the zodiac when it comes to their relationship with others, but they are rarely entirely honest with themselves. Capricorn feels this and recognizes the lack of inner honesty that doesn’t seem to change. The problem here is in the fact that Capricorn is the sign of Jupiter’s fall and this is the ruler of Sagittarius, as well as the traditional ruler of Pisces. The magic of life and the beliefs that lead in a certain direction seem to be lost on Capricorn. They know with certainty that the only things that give results are their rational mind and hard work. How can someone like Sagittarius explain to them that beliefs create their reality and that it is enough to believe in a good outcome, to affect the entire web of circumstances in a positive way? This issue comes down to a problem with trust, but in fact it goes much deeper than that."},"Intellect":{"Value":75,"Description":"A Sagittarius and a Capricorn can be full of understanding for each other, if they don’t jump into a battle over their belief systems. Sagittarius has that optimistic smile that will definitely put a smile on Capricorn’s face too, and it will get much easier for those fiery, creative ideas of Sagittarius to find their grounding through Capricorn’s practical approach. With enough respect, this is a couple that links a visionary with a builder, and there is really nothing they cannot make when together. If they don’t expect change from one another, they are very likely to be extremely intellectually compatible.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most beautiful thing in this contact is in their complementing protective roles. Both of these signs represent protection, Sagittarius ruled by the greatest benefic and Capricorn as our fence, our shell to the outer world. When they manage to build a functional core, these are partners that will never let anyone else affect their relationship. If they are in search of someone who will not allow interfering, meddling and any type of disrespect from other people, this relationship might be their best choice."},"Emotions":{"Value":55,"Description":"Sagittarius and Capricorn can find a shared emotional language due to the fact that Capricorn needs someone like their opposing sign to complete them, and Sagittarius tends to become that sign as a place of Jupiter’s exaltation. This is where their hearts meet and if there is enough faith in a Sagittarius, without any unrealistic expectations, they might fall in love deeply. There is a small chance that a Sagittarius will be that mellow, tender person a Capricorn needs, but this is something that can be overcome with enough closeness and understanding of their differences."},"Values":{"Value":20,"Description":"There is one important thing these partners agree on, and that is the value of intelligence. Sagittarius is a mental sign, focused on philosophy and learning, always in search for unity, synthesis and that universal truth. Capricorn is the logical continuance of Sagittarius, as a practical tool that uses knowledge. If they don’t find each other stupid, they will click in the same wavelength without much trouble, and discover that they share a certain depth and curiosity that isn’t obvious at first glance. Still, most of their values differ greatly and their needs are often too far off. While one of them values freedom, width and creativity, the other values practicality, responsibility and focus."},"Activities":{"Value":60,"Description":"Even though we would think that a Sagittarius will get bored and want to run off from their Capricorn partner, in most cases this doesn’t happen. The lack of relationship between their Suns helps their bond with a certain lack of disrespect. This leads them into a situation in which a Sagittarius finds their Capricorn partner interesting, as an extraterrestrial they have always wanted to meet. They are different enough to be interested in each other with genuine curiosity and a Sagittarius is always ready to try out something new. Capricorn will probably refuse many of the childish activities Sagittarius suggests, but it becomes fun to talk them into it and there is a note of laughter and joy in these attempts.

We can see two partners that exalt Mars, meaning their libidos are strong and they have the need to follow their instincts. But we can also see two people who hold on to their restrictions, who deny themselves the right for satisfaction and choose to make rational decisions every single day. Practicality doesn’t go well with sexuality, and while other partners can awake their sexual creativity and form an intimate bond with them, two Capricorn partners will rarely satisfy each other in a sexual and an emotional sense combined.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn top of this, there is a fact that their sign is a ruler of time itself, and the most probable outcome of their contact is an endless wait for anything to happen. None of them lacks initiative as they do both exalt Mars, but when it comes to taboos and matters of the flesh, two Capricorn partners can’t seem to get to the point in which they actually take their clothes off. When they start a sexual relationship, they could go to one of two extremes. Either they will fully understand each other’s needs with very few words, or they will just hit the wall every time any partner wishes to create a more intimate atmosphere."},"Trust":{"Value":80,"Description":"Why wouldn’t you trust a Capricorn when you are a Capricorn? Probably because you know you are a better, more honest version of a Capricorn. There is a strange need for a competition between these partners, and this won’t exactly help them believe each other or trust their future all together. The problem here doesn’t come down to lies, but to silences they decide to create. If they form that quiet but tense air around them when they try to communicate, both of them will question each other to the point in which they lose sight of who their partner actually is."},"Intellect":{"Value":65,"Description":"There is so much two Capricorns have to discuss. For five minutes. Yes, their intellectual relationship can become a debate arena, but chances are greater for a silent tournament in which none of them can ever win. If they don’t speak their mind, analyzing each other like guinea pigs, they won’t get very far, and their respect will be shattered as soon as this becomes clear to both of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn many cases, two Capricorns won’t even feel the need to talk to each other that much. They would have a lot to say, both of them interested in each other’s lives and stories, but with a fence in front of their faces that doesn’t give them the opportunity to truly share. If they work on the same project and find themselves in a situation in which they have to talk, they will discover many things they agree on. In order to build a relationship with the right amount of meaningful conversations, it is best for them to work together and solve the same situations with a shared mind. As they resolve equations of life with one another, they might start enjoying their communication a lot."},"Emotions":{"Value":30,"Description":"Emotional contact between two Capricorns can be a very interesting thing. These are partners that rely on their lack of emotion most of the time, always trying to be cold, controlling and rational. When they get together, they will most likely recognize these characteristics, but that won’t make them any less annoyed by who their partner is. It is a good thing they share the same approach to all relationships, being unable to open up until someone lets the pressure drop and makes them feel safe and secure to express how they feel.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they truly fall in love with each other, they will need a lot of time to say this out loud, for both of them dread any public displays of emotion and don’t feel confident enough for private displays either. They can be saved by a simple word of confidence, and by their understanding of each other’s emotional depth that isn’t easily reached. Respect, however, won’t be enough for them to share the feelings that need to be shared, and they tend to leave each other be, in a certain silence, because of that understanding they have for similarities of their natures. Unfortunately, this drives them even further apart as they fight to remain in an emotional connection by using only their brains."},"Values":{"Value":80,"Description":"Even though they are members of the same Sun sign, every Capricorn is a specific individual with their own set of values that have to be set in stone. It is not easy for one Capricorn to find another Capricorn to share them. The rigid nature of Capricorn doesn’t allow much understanding when it comes to behavior that “isn’t approved” and being a Capricorn doesn’t exclude anyone from the primal equations each of them sets. They should stick to the values they share instead of questioning those they don’t.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Activities":{"Value":75,"Description":"Two Capricorn partners could share any possible activity that comes into their minds, but one of them, or both, simply won’t. It is hard to determine why when they have the time and the energy, and the only logical explanation seems to be – out of spite. Who would say that loyal, responsible Capricorn has this need inside their mind and their heart? When they loosen up and realize that their partner is not threatening them, the two of them will find many things to do together. Still, they might not understand where they need to show up and what is truly important to their partner. If they lose their closeness enough to lose the understanding of each other’s needs and desires, there is a big chance they will have to end their relationship and find someone a bit more compassionate and mellow."},"Summary":{"Value":62,"Description":"The relationship of two Capricorn partners isn’t really ideal. One minus might give a plus with the other minus, but these two turn to whatever is the opposite of functional as soon as another dominant partner (Capricorn) comes into their life. The game of superiority they will have trouble containing can become the main stream of their relationship, leading them toward an inevitable end. In order to stay together, they need to point their horns into someone or something else, and make room for emotion they both need in order to find balance."}},"Aquarius":{"Love":{"Value":5,"Description":"It would be easy to make a simple assumption that Capricorn is traditional and restricting, while Aquarius is the opposite, but they are both traditionally ruled by the same planet and it would be silly not to understand their similarities. The main problem in their sex life will be their different pace, and this is mostly caused by the difference in their elements.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an Earth sign, Capricorn is slow and thorough. A representative of this sign will rarely jump into a sexual relationship without attraction and respect for another person, and will want to give their best performance when sex finally happens. Aquarius is an Air sign and this does make them kind of flaky and unreliable, although they are ruled by Saturn, the master of reliability. They will want things spontaneous and fast, without much thinking and as relaxed as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is very rare for an Aquarius to have patience to wait for Capricorn to make a detailed plan, and this will be a great turn off for Capricorn because they don’t like anything done in haste and the heat of the moment, especially when it comes to sex. They can both be very passionate when with the right partner, but the starting point in their approaches is usually simply too different to work out. Fortunately, the respect they will have for each other could make them become very good friends and if they manage to find the right way to communicate, they might even build a quality sexual relationship on a foundation of friendship."},"Trust":{"Value":80,"Description":"Why wouldn’t they trust one another? One of them has stone cold convictions and the need to never be wrong or make a mistake of any kind, while the other has no fear of confrontation and values the image of truth among the human race too much to have the desire to lie. Their ideas of trust are different though, and it will be hard for both of them to accept each other’s natures the way they were meant to be. The lack of trust between them is not really the lack of trust they have in each other, but in the possibility this kind of relationship will work out."},"Intellect":{"Value":65,"Description":"An intellectual relationship between a Capricorn and an Aquarius can be kind of painful to watch when you are, for example, a Taurus or a Cancer. They have this distant, cold, silent agreement that they are both worth each other’s respect and this can seem terrifying at times as they distance from each other in order to remain in this agreement. They would rather be in no relationship than look at each other in a different way, and because of this they could form a beautiful, lasting friendship.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, it is important to remember how different they are. Although there is no real freedom for Aquarius if the rules of their preceding sign aren’t followed, it is not easy for them to understand each other’s way of living. For as long as they hold on to shared interests and their mutual love for the seriousness of their bond, they will be able to maintain the image of a strong intellectual bond that makes them both satisfied."},"Emotions":{"Value":5,"Description":"The emotional side of a relationship between a Capricorn and an Aquarius is something really strange. In general interpretations they are both supposed to be unemotional, detached and closed up for emotional interaction with other people. However, this is not exactly the root of their lack of emotional connection.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an Earth sign, Capricorn needs emotions to be shown in a physical, practical way. This is exactly why they are often described as selfish, taking care only of their own needs. It is not easily accepted by the more spiritual signs that someone gives so much attention to earthly things such as money, or any material or career oriented value. Aquarius belongs to the element of Air and it is a sign of ultimate overall faith, different than any religion or rule that a human might have created. They need heavenly love, someone to share all of their ideas with, so they can float together on a cloud to Neverland. They will not care much about money, food or even sex, if their elevated spirit gets wings and they get yet another chance to dream. In order to form an emotional bond, both Capricorn and Aquarius will have to accept the other side of reality.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Values":{"Value":40,"Description":"Capricorn values boundaries and Aquarius values freedom. So how could they ever possibly be in a loving relationship? It is sometimes easy to forget that the sign of Capricorn precedes Aquarius and that there would be no sense of liberation without enough pressure. Their roles are intertwined in a strange way and they could find themselves valuing the exact same things if they dig into their personalities a bit deeper. To start with, they both value consistency and loyalty, and they will both consider all of the standard humane evaluations of people necessary. They will choose their relationships on the same grounds when it comes to long term commitments and rarely allow others to control them."},"Activities":{"Value":25,"Description":"None of these signs lacks energy. Capricorn exalts Mars and knows exactly where to drain it and Aquarius doesn’t really know what to do with it anyway. Even though they won’t often choose the same activities, this should help them follow each other for long enough to determine what they both might like. It is only necessary for Aquarius partner no to force, insist and speed up, and Capricorn needs not to inhibit, restrict and deny."},"Summary":{"Value":37,"Description":"Capricorn and Aquarius might not find each other that interesting to begin with. Both of these sings are traditionally ruled by Saturn, but their roles in the zodiac are entirely different. Their most challenging point in a relationship is their emotional contact. If they are to stay together, Capricorn partner will have to separate from the ground, just a little, and Aquarius will have to come a bit closer to Earth. They need to meet in the middle for Capricorn will be able to help Aquarius materialize their ideas, and Aquarius to be able to help Capricorn make the needed change in their life and turn to something new."}},"Pisces":{"Love":{"Value":99,"Description":"There is probably no better way for a Capricorn to relax, than to enter a relationship with a Pisces partner. Their sexual relationship is a contact of two powerful individuals, one of them extremely strict and rational, and another flexible and emotional but confident about their beliefs. Differences between them will create a strong attraction, almost as if they were opposing signs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sex life these partners can share is unexplainable when their characters are superficially observed. But in a different way than a Cancer, Pisces can reach emotional depth of Capricorn by a simple feel. This is not a matter of compassion, but a matter of their deep inner truths. Capricorn isn’t unemotional, however obvious their coldness might be, and Pisces can be quite rational, even though they seem lost in emotion. They can awaken the best qualities in each other and share strong intimacy through deep emotionally-rational understanding.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir sex life will move in a strangely spontaneous way. Capricorn will be inspired to let go and open up to their partner, while Pisces will easily ground their affections and find a way to show them through physical contact. Capricorn will feel more casual and Pisces will start to gather themselves up. If they stay together for long enough, they could make a perfect blend of stability, trust and emotional excitement."},"Trust":{"Value":85,"Description":"They will often understand each other well enough to respect their relationship and keep it clear of dishonesty. This is not always the case, and the possible roughness of Capricorn can sometime induce Pisces to tell a lie or two. On the other hand, if Capricorn is closed up and unreachable, trust will be disturbed by a simple fact that they don’t know each other that well at all. The beauty of their relationship is in their approach to trust when they realize who they are dealing with. Since both of the partners don’t trust the world to open up easily, they will have to earn it, day by day, from each other. This might seem like a game or a competition to win over the trust of their partner."},"Intellect":{"Value":65,"Description":"If anyone can inspire a Capricorn, it is their Pisces partner. They can both care a lot about communication in their relationship, but their bond will allow them to stop talking and start listening. They are both shy in a way, and in order to get to know each other, they will have to be very careful to pay attention to one another. It is a good thing they will both want to do so, intrigued by their partner’s nature, excited about getting to know each other in depth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem in their communication can arise when Capricorn gives in to their rigid opinions and beliefs. The sign of Capricorn brings Jupiter to its fall, and Jupiter is traditionally the ruler of Pisces. This could truly endanger their entire relationship, for the strict and rational nature of Capricorn can damage the faith and the convictions of Pisces through simple disbelief. Pisces partner will rarely give up on their belief system, since this is what they live for, but they could question it and feel lonely because of the lack of understanding from their partner. “What will be, will be” might become “I decide what will be” and this can suffocate the spontaneity and the inspiration that Pisces partner carries within."},"Emotions":{"Value":90,"Description":"These partners share a deep emotional bond that can be built for years until it truly blossoms. The most wonderful side of their relationship is in the expectance of emotion, the constant growth and their ability to bring out the best in each other. Still, this doesn’t mean any of them will actually change their ways, even though they will be the best they can be. Capricorn might remain grumpy, while Pisces might remain flaky and unreliable. When they are too set in their ways, they could end up truly annoying each other as Capricorn quenches the beliefs and the magic of Pisces, and Pisces disappoints reliable, earthly Capricorn."},"Values":{"Value":45,"Description":"There is a certain consistency in their way of approaching their values. It is strange how someone like Pisces can value stable emotions that much, but they help them to finally rest their mind and their heart when they are in a stable emotional relationship. Capricorn will surprisingly value one’s ability to be in touch with their emotions and have a clear vision of a positive outcome.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately, they will have a real problem in approaching the use of beliefs and emotions in everyday life, and while Capricorn will value coolheaded thinking and one’s ability to be rational, Pisces will value the opposite. They will sometimes be too different, Pisces dreaming of a perfect love, Capricorn knowing it is impossible, Pisces imagining a God with a golden beard, Capricorn believing in this moment, or visiting a church because of tradition rather than belief. It won\'t be easy but they might value each other enough to overcome their differences."},"Activities":{"Value":70,"Description":"When they begin their relationship, they will want to do everything together. Even though their interests are usually very different, Capricorn will be inspired to get inside the world of Pisces, as much as Pisces will want to solve the equation inside their Capricorn partner. In time, their activities will separate, as they realize that things Capricorn wants to do are boring to Pisces, while things Pisces like to do, drive Capricorn crazy – with no plan, no intent or any kind of seeming usefulness. Still, they will both have a need to hold on to tradition, Capricorn for respect of tradition itself, and Pisces for romantic reasons, and this should help them build enough shared activities as time passes."},"Summary":{"Value":76,"Description":"A relationship between Capricorn and Pisces tells a story about possibilities of inspiration. If someone like Capricorn can be pulled into a crazy love story, exciting and unpredictable, this must be done by Pisces. In return, Capricorn will offer their Pisces partner stability, peace and some rest from their usual emotional tornadoes. There is a fine way in which Capricorn can help Pisces be more realistic and practical, while feeling more cheerful and optimistic themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, there are challenges in their contact, mainly represented through their love of Jupiter. It might be hard for them to reconcile their different approaches to religion, faith and their different belief systems. To overcome this, it is best if they both ask themselves – does their belief system work? And does the one of their partner also work? If they understand answers to these questions, they might find enough respect to leave each other’s Jupiter intact."}}},"Aquarius":{"Aries":{"Love":{"Value":65,"Description":"Sexual contact between signs of Aries and Aquarius can be really stressful or extremely exciting. Usually it is both. Their signs go well together in general and they support each other easily, since they both have a lot of energy to follow one another. Still, when it comes to their sexual and intimate relations, they could lack emotion. Aries is a passionate sign with lot of warm, creative emotions. This is a relationship that could bring out their worst nature and simply emphasize that they are a sign ruled by Mars – a cold, unemotional sexual hunter. While this can be really exciting to both of them, it will not be very fulfilling, because they both need to feel loved.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is an excess of masculinity and energy that could lead to very turbulent relations. Their roles are easy to understand with Aries giving energy and stamina to their Aquarius partner, and Aquarius giving crazy ideas and widening horizons of their Aries. This is very fun at the beginning of their relationship, but after a while, it might get tiresome for there are not enough ideas to cover the emotional emptiness they could encounter."},"Trust":{"Value":85,"Description":"Trust is an important issue for Aries and Aquarius can understand that. This doesn’t mean they will be faithful to their Aries partner forever, but they would think it is fair to keep an open relationship and tell them about their indiscretions. Unfortunately, Aries is ruled by Mars and needs to be the only one in the world that their partner ever lays eyes on. This could turn them into an angry, possessive person who obsesses about the movements of their partner.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we are discussing matters of trust between them that don’t include other people, it is safe to say that they don’t have a problem. They both simply don’t understand why they would lie when there are so many interesting truths to discover. They need to be free to speak their mind and accept that they will never avoid conflict, but that it can be used in a constructive way to better understand each other and strengthen their relationship."},"Intellect":{"Value":90,"Description":"Their conversations can be so exciting that many people would like to jump in. Aries is often kind of serious and asks for their boundaries to be respected. Aquarius partner will recognize this, laugh and shake their entire world. It is unimaginable to Aries, always moving straight, for someone to have such an open mind, going back and front, having new revelations every day and never losing energy for new, different topics.\\r\\n\\r\\nAries could find an idol in their Aquarius partner and full-heartedly enter any dialogue because they are excited about what they might discover and how their perspective would change. On the other hand, Aquarius enjoys this role in their partner’s life due to their ego issues with the Sun positioned at this sign. They will share their thoughts with their partner, trying to be as interesting as possible. Aquarius is motivated by their Aries partner and enjoys making tiny jokes at their expense. It is important for Aries not to take things personally when it comes to Aquarius humor and they might have a lot of fun together.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of their strong natures, filled with energy, they could fight most of the time. In most cases, Aquarius will not stand for ridiculous conflicts and will build a brick wall somewhere between them if needed. Still, they usually tear it down at the end of the day, for they cherish each other the way they are after all"},"Emotions":{"Value":40,"Description":"In order for Aquarius to awaken their emotional nature, it usually takes a partner with enough flexibility and patience to get there. We wouldn’t exactly say that Aries is patient, so you can imagine the problem that could appear. From the perspective of an Aries, their partner is cold, distant and has no intention of opening their heart for them. Aquarius sees things differently and tries to stay rational at all times. When Aries starts asking for the show of emotion, the true problem surfaces, for Aquarius might have shown how they feel the entire time, but no one would guess what they were showing."},"Values":{"Value":30,"Description":"Although they can share a great conversation, their values go their separate ways as soon as they touch the subject of freedom. They both value freedom by first impulse. But in time, Aries realizes that they don’t really value freedom that much when they see it at work. In fact, they would often change everything in their lives only to take away the freedom from their Aquarius partner. This is not a conscious need, but Aries can be like a spoiled child wanting things (and people) all for themselves. So with Aquarius changing direction as the wind and never changing their nature, Aries can find themselves truly unhappy for they want someone to share everything with, not only what the wind carries in."},"Activities":{"Value":99,"Description":"Unless Aquarius suggests something truly unacceptable to their Aries partner, they will have an abundance of possibilities when it comes to their shared activities. With so much energy, their only mistake would be to stay at home and not share a chance to get all that energy out of their systems."},"Summary":{"Value":68,"Description":"This is a couple that lacks tenderness. They are not two brutes who let their relationship fade as soon as their passion does, but the distant examining look of Aquarius can take out the emotion out of it. Aries partner needs to be relaxed by their significant other, so they can melt down and show their true, warm emotional nature. In this relationship, they would have a distant partner that basically supports their primal, instinctive nature. Although it is nice to think that the point of each relationship is for partners to accept each other as they are, in this case that would take away every chance for an Aries to grow through togetherness and learn about their emotional nature. This is something they will never be satisfied with.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, every relationship with Aquarius can surprise us as much as any individual Aquarius could. With them as a partner, there is always room for an enlightening scenario that leaves all things to free will. In case they decide to share their lives together, they should have a screaming room they could individually visit once in a while. This would probably do the trick. And about that lack of emotion, they could just put in a lot of physical tenderness to begin with and let things go from there."}},"Taurus":{"Love":{"Value":15,"Description":"\\r\\nThe slow, tender and smooth nature of Taurus will be ridiculously annoyed by the changeable and unusual nature of Aquarius. In most cases, they are not even attracted to each other and think of each other as boring or crazy, depending on the situation. However, they could really help each other blossom if they opened up for the possibility of unusual sexual encounters.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the tenderness of Taurus is projected on their independent, distant Aquarius partner, their creative and motivating side would awake, giving energy and speed to the productive gentle side of Taurus. Imagine the sex life they could have, different from each other, two outcasts, if they only shared enough respect and emotion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey will rarely get this far, for they seem to be looking for different things in a relationship to begin with. Taurus would like to have a secure, unbreakable partnership and Aquarius wants to be free of any attachment to this world, let alone emotional relationships. It is not easy for them to mend these differences or keep them out of their sex life, because they wouldn’t feel like themselves in a relationship with disregard of their primal needs."},"Trust":{"Value":20,"Description":"If Taurus wasn’t so stressed out by their Aquarius partner, they might decide to be true and honest. Aquarius doesn’t really understand the attitude Taurus has and least of all their fear of not being good enough. Guilt and self-criticism is the most difficult trait of Taurus, and one Aquarius is free from, finding it obsolete. This strict Aquarius opinion will scare Taurus to the point where they feel it is impossible to tell how they feel. This will end in a circle of lies and mistrust that cannot be repaired.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere seems to be no flexibility in an Aquarius partner, although they tend to show a nature that is so open for people’s differences. In order to build the subtle trust, Taurus needs to be brave and stop thinking about the consequences of everything they say, while Aquarius needs to let go of their righteous attitude and be careful about the way their Taurus partner feels in their presence."},"Intellect":{"Value":10,"Description":"As a contact of Earth and Air elements, they can be so far apart that they can’t find anything to talk about. The sign of Taurus brings Uranus to its fall and all of those bright ideas Aquarius has, seem to go through the sieve of reality given by Taurus. This wouldn’t be a problem per se, but sometimes the narrow-minded Taurus doesn’t exactly see the true possibilities of the material world and can bring down their Aquarius partner to the point where they don’t see how any of their dreams is possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Taurus shows understanding for their partner’s need to fly, they could actually help them materialize what they have dreamed about. This doesn’t happen often, for Aquarius rarely finds Taurus as a person to talk to, slow and boring with a “small town” attitude that inhibits the progress of our civilization.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir differences are hard to reconcile and when they fall in love, every little thing could become a huge problem and a reason for both of them to think about ending the relationship. If Taurus wants a white picket fence, Aquarius wants a condo on 67th floor. If Taurus yearns for compassion, Aquarius doesn’t care about opinions of others. If Taurus wants to go by foot, Aquarius wants to buy a plane ticket. In general, they can find that they aren’t exactly made for each other, unless they both have enough flexibility to understand the ultimate difference in others, and enough openness to do things they don’t care about just to see if they like them in the end."},"Emotions":{"Value":15,"Description":"They are lucky that the sign of Aquarius lifts up spirits of Venus, or they wouldn’t really stand a chance. Taurus will rarely fall in love with an Aquarius due to the fact that they don’t recognize their ruler in a good context. Aquarius is distant enough as it is, and without excitement some other signs might offer, they will not exactly feel the electricity of being in love with an unmovable Taurus. However, they both might get tricked by the middle ground between them. If Taurus sees the stable, Saturn side of Aquarius, and Aquarius recognizes the inner child in their Taurus partner, they could discover that they do belong together, even though this goes against the odds."},"Values":{"Value":1,"Description":"While Taurus values material things and grounded behavior, Aquarius values freedom in any shape and form. One of them wants to be tied down, and the other wants to fly. There is really not much they can do, but accept the differences of their goals and natures, for there is truth and good in both approaches to life. They can find certain things to value together, if they put their minds into creating them through Aquarius field of ideas and Taurus’ practical realizations."},"Activities":{"Value":5,"Description":"For a short time there could be a number of beautiful things they could do together. After the recourses of Taurus have been spent, there is not much else they will want to do together. By “recourses” we don’t necessarily speak of money, but the overall energy for action. Taurus will gladly visit a strange place they have never been to, but after this, they will want to come home and have a nice dinner. Aquarius doesn’t have this need and wants to always be on the move. They could be taken care of through the efforts of their Taurus partner, if they had enough patience to keep them well fed, dressed in clean clothes and took care of household activities. Still, this compromise is rare to find, because the emotional satisfaction Taurus partner will get in return is not enough."},"Summary":{"Value":11,"Description":"Taurus and Aquarius are people from two different worlds. Still, there is a strange similarity and connection between their rulers and although very challenging, this is a relationship where both partners could fall in love with each other, over and over again, every single day. They are ruled by Venus and Uranus, both planets rotating in a direction opposite to the direction of other planets. They are two outcasts, different and standing out together, they understand that East can be where West is, and vice versa. They understand diversity, change of direction and the excitement of love. However, they will rarely get to the point to understand each other because of their excessive need for peace (Taurus) and excitement (Aquarius). What a strange pair these signs are. With such an obvious opportunity for electric love, they go around it and search for something else."}},"Gemini":{"Love":{"Value":85,"Description":"Gemini and Aquarius could probably have sex by simple verbal stimulation. They don’t need to get naked to have a sexual experience, although they will want to be naked all the time to set themselves free from all the human restrictions represented through clothes. They will get lost on their way to somewhere and have sex there. Or somewhere else. But who cares when they are in search for kindred spirits and want to have a good time while at it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey will both be aroused by the intellectual side of their relationship and if they are to be satisfied, they have to consider each other intelligent. Neither Gemini nor Aquarius will ever be in a serious relationship with someone who is, in their opinion, stupid. Even something that they would call an “insignificant sexual encounter” has to be with someone with enough wit and something to say.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey can have sex anywhere and none of them would care. Gemini is a bit childish and can be ashamed in certain situations, but when Aquarius takes over, Gemini will realize that there is no limit to their freedom of expression. These partners will try everything, communicate excessively and learn quickly about each other’s body and the way to satisfy one another. Still, their relationship could lack emotion and true physical intimacy. This could lead to them pulling apart, often not aware that they both need something else in their partner."},"Trust":{"Value":90,"Description":"Trust is a strange thing for this couple. We should emphasize that they will trust each other. Aquarius finds lying ridiculous and Gemini will usually feel free enough not to lie. On the other hand, Aquarius understands one’s need for privacy, for this is a sign where Neptune is exalted. They will both probably have this ultimate trust for their partner and are rarely deceived because of their premise to give and receive freedom as an absolute priority. None of them will have any satisfaction in storytelling or lying when there are so many interesting things to talk about with their weirdo partner, and so little to share that will be judged."},"Intellect":{"Value":99,"Description":"When Gemini and Aquarius engage in an intellectual debate, they are fun for everyone to watch. They stimulate each other’s mind to such a point that they fire arguments they weren’t aware existed in their thoughts. While Gemini will probably be fascinated by the belief system of Aquarius, always so rational and humane, Aquarius will have an opportunity to relieve some of their ego problem with their Gemini partner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mutable quality of Gemini will allow them to adapt to some of those rigid Aquarian attitudes and opinions, even if they disagree. Gemini does have this mellow nature that understands the flow of the social touch with other people, and will rarely fight for their beliefs with someone they feel really close to. This is a good thing for their everyday life, but in general, this can present a problem because the authentic personality of Gemini could be shushed until they are not sure who they are anymore, once again.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is important for them to have enough flexibility for one another, however different their premises might be. Still, it is best if they share the same basic life philosophy, which they usually do, or they could get distant and lose interest in each other. As two Air representatives they find that communication is the solution to any problem, but aren’t aware how far from Earth they might get with their ideas unrealized and their goals unreached because of too much talk, and too little action."},"Emotions":{"Value":40,"Description":"We could say that Gemini and Aquarius understand each other perfectly when it comes to their emotions. Usually this is true, but that doesn’t mean this is what they both need. The unstable nature of Gemini can make them change their mind or their emotional state on a daily basis, and if they don’t feel good in a relationship, they will set themselves free without overthinking the reasons why they had to do so. Aquarius is always in a rush to set themselves free from anyone or anything, so a breakup wouldn’t really be something strange in their world.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn most cases, their rational, mental natures will complement each other in an exciting way, but there is not much emotion to be built in the core of their relationship. It seems that both of these partners need to find someone a bit warmer in order to feel things more deeply and light their passionate hearts. They will much more often become friends than lovers, even if they were attracted to each other when they first met."},"Values":{"Value":95,"Description":"Suffice it to say that they both value intellect. The rest is just something that other signs worry about. However, Aquarius can be very passionate about their humane beliefs and will often support them strongly. This is something Gemini can understand but rarely supports. Because of the fact that Aquarius partner values equality of the people as much as their own freedom, this can be their point of separation, even though Gemini partner does not really disagree."},"Activities":{"Value":99,"Description":"Aquarius is the only sign capable to really surprise Gemini. They are so different than everyone else and represent a step that Gemini should climb if they want their life to be unbelievable. This is not always the case because some of the Aquarius’ weirdness can be a show off, designed by their need to mend their turbulent Sun. Still, it is exciting for them both to enter this relationship – Aquarius to surprise and Gemini to follow them wherever they go. Their main activity to be shared is movement. They could drive thousands of miles just to find a specific ice cream or for no reason at all. Mostly they can do anything together, from travelling and clubbing, to reading labels and instructions on the use of different kitchenware."},"Summary":{"Value":85,"Description":"Gemini needs a partner who doesn’t bore them or make them feel inhibited. When you look at things this way, you could say that there is no better match for them than the fabulous Aquarius. Aquarius needs someone to understand their grandiose ideas and discuss each one with them, and also someone who doesn’t make them feel inhibited. Who could do this better than Gemini? However, they could find themselves in a relationship that doesn’t have enough emotion and compassion, and this is certain to surface as soon as the first disturbing thing happens in the life of one of these partners. They need to work on their emotional base and their non-verbal understanding if they want their relationship to last."}},"Cancer":{"Love":{"Value":1,"Description":"A sexual relationship between Cancer and Aquarius can be stressful for both partners. Although Cancer is considered the most sensitive sign of the zodiac, governed by the Moon, they can be quite rough and distant when they feel the need to set strong boundaries. Aquarius, on the other hand, is known as an innovator, someone to make the change, but in fact, they are a fixed sign, pretty set in their ways and as a paradox – unchangeable.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they engage in sexual activity, Cancer could be so stressed that they will have to set those boundaries and Aquarius will not be able to make the needed change to be gentler to their Cancer partner. There is too much energy in Aquarius that needs to be grounded through their physical activity and this includes sex. Cancer doesn’t really understand this and is convinced that in sexual relations with someone you love only emotions should be shared.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Aquarius finds a way to slow down and not force anything on their partner, and if Cancer allows their rational mind to take over for some of the time they spend together, they might share an exciting sexual experience. Cancer will bring emotions and tenderness to their sex life and Aquarius won’t ever let boring routine take over. If they compromise on experimenting and emotional exchange, they could even start having fun.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Trust":{"Value":35,"Description":"Cancer is usually loyal and honest, except in situations when they are scared of the aggressive reaction of their loved one, or of hurting them badly. With Aquarius, they might feel stressed to share things and this could present a both way issue when it comes to trust. The liberal nature of Aquarius could seem crazy to a Cancer, and their partner’s honesty about their craziness won’t help the inner feeling of mistrust for their possible actions. It is a complicated thing for them, because none of them wants to lie, but still they don’t seem to trust the future they might share."},"Intellect":{"Value":55,"Description":"Cancer and Aquarius are able to join forces in intellectual activity. The mind of a Cancer is sensitive enough to pay attention to details and interpersonal relationships when Aquarius fails to do so. They could make grand ideas come true, especially those that need a lot of people involved on their way to become real.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, they might have trouble talking to one another in the same tone or understanding each other in the first place. Cancer is ruled by the Moon, the fastest heavenly body in the sky, but they are not fast to recognize what hides behind Aquarius’ words. There is difficulty for Aquarius to express their inner state and this is something Cancer has trouble understanding.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best beginning of their relationship is guaranteed if Aquarius sees their Cancer partner as a weird human being that needs to be examined. This will allow them both enough space to get to know each other well, and this could influence all other areas of their relationship. If this happens, Aquarius will approach those strange activities Cancer needs as if they weren’t ordinary at all. After all, not everyone can drink a morning coffee in total silence with their partner and enjoy this silence as much as these partners can."},"Emotions":{"Value":50,"Description":"The unconventional nature of Aquarius interferes with Cancer’s need to stay in a peaceful environment, and this is something they will find hardest to reconcile. That homey, cozy feeling Cancer needs can be deeply disturbed by the rebellious Air sign of Aquarius. They will bring stress and too much information in their life, and speed that cannot be handled by a subtle state of deep empathy Cancer has to live with daily.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe way they show love is very different, but it can be wonderfully focused on their kids and the family they build if they get to this point. There is no sign in the zodiac predestined for a family life such as Cancer. In a relationship with Aquarius, they would take over the most of everyday activities and responsibilities. In return, their children would get a childhood without boundaries and a life of free choices that no other couple can give. This is a consequence of the difference between them and the tolerance they have to build in order to stay together.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they do fall in love, they will not be so quick to end their relationship. Aquarius will approach it as a kind of challenge and understand the stability and love they get from this partner. Cancer will realize that they have never been this free to actually be themselves instead of living in a symbiotic relationship they are easily sucked into. Once they form a strong bond, it will be very hard for both of them to let it go."},"Values":{"Value":10,"Description":"Cancer values knowledge almost as much as Aquarius values information. This is a fine connection between their worlds and if it is nurtured it could be just enough for them not to be set apart by other values they hold on to. Cancer does value stability, intimacy and family, while Aquarius values their freedom, intellect and new technology. There is a difference between their worlds that might seem impossible to overcome, but if they hold on to their love of distances and travel or if they learn together, they could easily get over the fact that their values on other things differ so much.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Activities":{"Value":25,"Description":"While Cancer will want to stay at home, go for a picnic in the park or to a furniture store, Aquarius will look for the highest skyscraper, wish for a new laptop and read anything that falls into their hands. The key activity that could truly connect them is travel. Although Cancer seems homey and unmovable, this is not exactly true. Due to the fact that it is a sign of Jupiter’s exaltation, they will want to travel far. Aquarius will always want to board a plane and it would be perfect if they could parachute to a location where Cancer would safely land in a Boeing 747.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Summary":{"Value":31,"Description":"We could say that Cancer and Aquarius are not your usual happy couple in most cases. Their relationship can be too stressful for Cancer partner and the lack of intimacy will most probably tear them apart. However, the link between them can actually be wonderful when found, and they could open up such interesting new perspectives for one another if this happens. They both want to learn new things and could travel far if a strong base is made at home, so Cancer can remain peaceful.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor this couple to move in a positive direction, Aquarius needs to understand how unusual their partner is, and try to experiment on being homey while having fun. Cancer will have to take over the main set of responsibilities to hold on to the idea of their home as a base from which they can move wherever they want. In the end, Cancer might discover an unbelievable joy of freedom and Aquarius might develop closeness. If these partners can be silent together, sipping on their morning coffee, this is in most cases the first step to success."}},"Leo":{"Love":{"Value":99,"Description":"The attraction is always great in relationships of opposing signs, and it is probably the greatest in a relationship of Leo and Aquarius. Leo is the king of the entire zodiac, and Aquarius seems to be there to bring down the king and fight for independence. Imagine the attraction and the passion between two such strong individuals, lying on the axis of Sun’s rule and detriment.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir sex life is a struggle, a fight and an incredible experience for both. Liberating and yet warm and passionate, sensual but still interesting. When they find true emotion, Aquarius might actually end up respecting the king. The beauty of their sex life is in things they can learn about their bodies, their confidence and the way they look at the act of sex. Through the struggle of insecurities and forced liberation, these are two partners to form a strong connection by a simple act of gravitation that the Sun has over Uranus."},"Trust":{"Value":75,"Description":"Everything seems clear in a relationship between Leo and Aquarius when we look at it from a distance. However, these signs represent the axis of Neptune’s exaltation and fall, and they will almost always have the challenge of trust and the search of truth in their relationship. Although they could find incredible understanding and freedom for both partners, usually when they separate they realize how little they have actually known about each other and how little trust they shared in the first place."},"Intellect":{"Value":90,"Description":"Both Leo and Aquarius are heroes in their own way. While Aquarius is reaching for heroism, looking for ways to set free from repression, Leo was born a hero and sometimes doesn’t even know it. If they end up fighting for the same cause, they could turn down entire governments and use their incredible force to change anything in the world. To get there, these two would have to stop the battle they have with each other, because energy can be scattered on their unnecessary fight for dominance in a relationship.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeo is a sign ruled by the Sun and has the ability to give clarity to any situation. No matter how confused they might be or how lost they may sound, if you take a closer look to the time spent with them, you will see that they’ve brought clarity in your life. Aquarius, on the other hand, understands the necessity of change and they seem to carry around a spark to ignite and excite any possible situation that they find worthy. This can be irritating to many, especially Leo, but in fact it is a necessity of liberation we all carry within."},"Emotions":{"Value":99,"Description":"Leo is exactly what Aquarius needs to find love. It is a strange thing how they find each other, on the grounds of their former relationships, to liberate and shine as if they have been searching for one another for many lifetimes. While Leo is the Sun, Aquarius is a lightning and it usually comes out on a rainy day. This is exactly what they need to understand – there is a time for both of them to shine and they don’t endanger each other’s chance to do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Leo falls in love, the entire world can feel it. The warmth pours out from the center of their being and one has to be blind or senseless not to pick up the signals. Aquarius can hide their emotions much better and often has trouble expressing and acknowledging how they feel. It is a good thing that Leo’s warm emotional nature will melt even the coldest of hearts and there will be no safer place for Aquarius to share their love than in these fiery arms. The only thing that can endanger their emotional relationship is their everlasting ego battle and they should both pay attention not to be too proud to let go to love."},"Values":{"Value":80,"Description":"The deepest value they share is the value of individuality. Someone with a strong character, who knows exactly what she or he wants, cannot stay unnoticed by Leo or Aquarius. Although they will not agree on many other things, this is the one that could connect them strongly, because they are both such strong individuals in the eyes of each other.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Activities":{"Value":90,"Description":"While Leo shines, Aquarius likes everything shiny. The need Leo has to show off might be a bit disturbed by Aquarius’ tendency to show what others don’t want to see. From a different perspective, this should help Leo feel more free and confident, although it might not seem so in the beginning. They will both like to show off, each in their own way, and it is only important for them to set the territory for both partners to be expressed. Just like the Sun and the lightning don’t go together, Aquarius should take over on a rainy day, in a depressive crowd or in places where they both feel as if they would drown. This is where Leo needs to give in and let their partner rule the sky if they are planning to keep the relationship going. There will be enough regular, shiny chances and days with no clouds for Leo to rule.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Summary":{"Value":89,"Description":"Signs of Leo and Aquarius combined represent the ultimate creativity, famous scientific discoveries, the first man in an airplane and the first man on the Moon. Imagine what these partners could do together if they let each other lead the way when the territory of their rule is in front of them. They both need to learn to let go of the image they have about themselves and about each other, or they won’t get very far stuck in their unnecessary ego battle. Warm and cold, hearted and smart, nuclear gravitation and vacuum in space, it cannot be easy to mend their differences or form a stable, loving relationship. The best thing they could do is find a cause they will support together. This would give them a focus on the outer world and allow them to deepen the inner emotional world of their relationship while fighting outside of it."}},"Virgo":{"Love":{"Value":1,"Description":"This is in no way an easy sexual relationship and unless some strong support is provided by their natal charts, Virgo and Aquarius will rarely be attracted to each other enough to start a sexual relationship at all. Their natures find it very hard to support each other, they are both intellectual but in a completely different way, and they will probably ruin any chance of a good sexual relationship by overthinking everything, each of them in their own direction.\\r\\n\\r\\nAquarius really holds on to their spontaneity, but who’s to say what does “spontaneity” really mean? They are rational when it comes to sex, and yet spontaneous? That sounds strange, doesn’t it? The truth is, they choose when to be spontaneous and their intellectual strength often gives them the image of spontaneity because they’ve seen the result faster than other, “not-so-spontaneous” people. This could ruin their sex life, because Virgo is one of those people and will usually think long and hard about starting a sexual relationship.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverthinking is a true turn-off for Aquarius, although they do it too just in a quicker pace, and they will rarely find Virgo’s analysis sexy in any way. Shy, thoughtful, sensitive Virgo will have trouble understanding their nude, weird and often too fast Aquarius partner. It is almost certain that none of them will have enough patience to build their sex life with someone so different from what they need."},"Trust":{"Value":50,"Description":"Their rational natures usually connect them in a trusting relationship, because they both find it stupid to lie or not trust their partner. Although Virgo can be tough on trust, with Aquarius it is obvious even to Virgo that a lack of trust would lead nowhere. Still, there is a great chance they will drift apart, even when their first contact is passionate and strong, because they could simply start feeling that both of them need someone different. If they want to hold on to their mutual trust, they need to keep their relationship fresh and accept each other for exactly who they are."},"Intellect":{"Value":40,"Description":"Virgo is ruled by Mercury and has a mutable quality to it, which gives it this changeable, moveable and adaptable nature. Aquarius has no trouble dealing with Mercury, in most situations, and will most certainly like this adaptable Virgo quality. As a fixed sign, Aquarius is usually set in their ways and this can be difficult to handle for someone so willing to sacrifice their happiness, such as Virgo. Their communication should mostly be good and their topics similar. They will share interest in many things and usually be excited about similar details.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, they belong to the most different elements of all – to Earth and Air. As an Earth sign, Virgo can be very slow, too thorough and rarely inspired enough for Aquarius to even feel the need to share their ideas with them. On the other hand, Aquarius can seem unrealistic or even crazy to their Virgo partner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best way for Virgo and Aquarius to function and be satisfied with their relationship, is to take each other seriously enough. With Virgo’s attention to detail, any plan for Aquarius’ brilliant mind to come to life is possible. Their communication might be tricky and the lack of compassion Aquarius suffers from will sometimes hurt Virgo, but they still have a great opportunity to combine their minds and form a universal intelligence capable of creating anything at all."},"Emotions":{"Value":35,"Description":"The emotional rollercoaster Aquarius gladly offers is something Virgo will probably despise. In case they do fall in love, they will have to deal with a constant fight for freedom and routine. Virgo is a sign of health and our daily routine, and its representatives can often be obsessed by their every meal or every checkup they’ve had with their doctor. Aquarius will in most cases avoid doctors at all costs and the fact that they exalt Neptune will mostly turn them to all sorts of alternative medicine, rather than anything typical that Virgo might hold on to.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe entire emotional world of their relationship could come down to Virgo worrying for their irresponsible Aquarius partner, and the lack of gratitude they might get in return. In fact, Aquarius usually doesn’t need to be taken care of in this way. This is a complicated emotional relationship because the worrying of Virgo degrades the personality of Aquarius and the best of intentions could have damaging consequences.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe biggest problem in the relationship of Virgo and Aquarius is in the fact they both heavily rely on their rational mind. This leaves no room for the joy of seduction, love and satisfaction, and usually they both need a partner with more warmth, life or emotion to them so they could both be happier."},"Values":{"Value":30,"Description":"Virgo and Aquarius will both value intelligence and a clear mind most of all. This doesn’t mean they will find the same people, actions or thoughts intelligent and they could often have opposite opinions on someone in their surroundings. Still, they could motivate each other to develop their intellectual strengths and hold on to this asset if other things in their relationship aren’t that good. Other things they value aren’t really similar and while Virgo would always choose practicality, Aquarius would choose the unknown and a not so understandable reality.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Activities":{"Value":25,"Description":"The work of any artist with a great mind could connect them and they could easily be interested in similar shows, galleries and plays. Their taste in many things can be almost the same, because the same attention to detail Virgo cherishes so much, makes some people great in their art and this is what fascinates Aquarius. However, Virgo is too cautious and predictable and most of the time they will have trouble fitting in that Aquarius\' too exciting, unpredictable world."},"Summary":{"Value":30,"Description":"Virgo can represent everything that Aquarius runs from – practical, worried about health and earthly things, down to Earth, cleaning obsessed maniac. Imagine how incredibly irresponsible, chaotic and unrealistic Aquarius looks to them. Their strongest meeting point is in their rationality and communication, and this can be used to overcome many problems that their differences result in. Unfortunately, in most cases they will not have enough chemistry to start a relationship, let alone stay in a sexually satisfying one for very long. If they take each other seriously, they might create incredible things together, as their great minds merge."}},"Libra":{"Love":{"Value":90,"Description":"Aquarius can truly help Libra express their sexuality. The problems with Libra’s Sun bring too much concern for opinions of other people, so representatives of this sing go to extremes when it comes to the way they show their sexuality. They will either be afraid to be judged and seem too asexual, or have a need to show it “in spite” of everyone’s opinion and this can be quite repulsive for their partner. When it comes to sexuality, Aquarius has an entirely different approach – they simply don’t care about anyone’s opinion. They live their life in a constant search for freedom from any taboos or restrictions, and this will help Libra forget about other people, at least for some time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough their sex life can be quite liberating for Libra, it can also be a bit challenging for Aquarius because they will be the one who has to fight against Libra’s need to fit in. However, as two Air signs, they will both tend to be free to express their sexual desires to each other. They will like to experiment, learn about each other and their own inner desires and communicate with ease. Their sexual relations should be a strong pillar of their entire relationship, although they will usually think of their verbal ways to get along as the most important for their bond.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Trust":{"Value":85,"Description":"Because of their righteous natures they could trust each other without exception, if they were only that sure of themselves. Their insecurities coincide very well, and they will usually help one another move through them, but the trust between them needs to be built, it is not implied. Both of these signs like to be attractive to different people and they should find a way to communicate this need in the right way. The problem can arise when Libra starts to get attached and becomes emotionally dependent on their partner. This is not something Aquarius will easily deal with and it could damage the trust of both partners, in each other and their entire relationship."},"Intellect":{"Value":40,"Description":"Libra and Aquarius both have certain images to maintain. Libra wants to look nice and act nice for others, while Aquarius wants to go in the opposite direction of everyone, sometimes even if there is no reason to do so. They are both stiff in their convictions and won’t easily change their mind once they are set on it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAquarius won’t have such a good time waiting for Libra to make any decision in their life, no more than Libra will enjoy the spontaneous, unpredictable nature of Aquarius. Since they both rely on communication, they will have a lot to talk about and will usually find a language to solve all of their issues. Still, it won’t be easy for them to reconcile some of the differences in their approach to things. Libra is indecisive but once they make a decision, they will rather stick to it than salvage their relationship, even if it is a simple meal in question. Aquarius will have a tendency to walk away as soon as they feel pressured into anything, even if it is that same meal. So basically, they could have an enormous problem about lunch if we talk about extremes.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, they usually understand each other well on usual, daily things and have similar convictions that help them handle big changes in life well. In time, as they get to know each other, their personalities will get along better and they could realize that they respect each other to a point that is unreachable with anybody else."},"Emotions":{"Value":80,"Description":"Libra is a sign ruled by Venus and this makes them emotional in a way, but we should remember that it is also a sign of Saturn’s exaltation and detachment is something that makes them feel very good. This is something they will get in a relationship with Aquarius and it could help them both build a very strong emotional bond. They have strangely different goals in life, but if they harmonize them, their emotional bond should be very strong and develop much faster than we would anticipate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe biggest obstacle that could present in their way is marriage, at some point in their relationship. Libra is a sign that represents marriage and finds it very meaningful as the institution Saturn would support. Aquarius might think of it as obsolete, even run from it and they will probably enter it only for practical reasons. It is important not to make pressure to any of the partners when this point in their relationship arises, or they might both feel repulsed and angry, leading to unnecessary conflicts and even the end of their relationship."},"Values":{"Value":50,"Description":"As much as Libra will value togetherness, Aquarius will value solitude. This could represent a big problem in their relationship, and Libra partner could seem clingy and not at all independent, while Aquarius might seem like an uncontrollable lunatic who would do anything to destroy all relationships in the world. Still, they both value communication and intellectual strengths enough to talk about their needs and desires, and this should help them overcome their differences."},"Activities":{"Value":65,"Description":"Aquarius will want to do anything, really, for as long as their life doesn’t fall into a boring routine. Libra will have trouble deciding what they want to do and this could drive their partner crazy. If something can launch Aquarius into the orbit it’s the lack of spontaneity and Libra can sometimes be the opposite of spontaneous. These partners could end up in a relationship in which only Aquarius pulls the strings and Libra follows. This wouldn’t really be a good solution for any of the partners, and Aquarius will have to learn to show some patience in order for respect between them to remain intact."},"Summary":{"Value":68,"Description":"There is a strong understanding between a Libra and an Aquarius partner due to their shared element of Air. Still, it can be quite difficult for their troubled Suns to get along and they will often have difficulty adjusting to each other’s character and finding deep respect for one another. The best cure for any problem in their relationship is usually in time, but with Aquarius’ need for spontaneity they often won’t last long enough for time to mend what gets broken. Whatever their story, they will have a lot of exciting things to live through together and if they fall in love, it would be a shame for a couple such as this one, not to give their relationship a try however it might end."}},"Scorpio":{"Love":{"Value":40,"Description":"Contact between a Scorpio and an Aquarius can be truly intense. As squaring signs, they should have a very troublesome contact, but the sign of Scorpio exalts the ruler of Aquarius, Uranus. These signs combined represent the ultimate sexual freedom, a place with no restrictions or taboos. They are a combination of Water and Air, of emotion and information, all combined in a strong scent of attraction. If they get tied to each other and break up, they could end up hating each other and despising everything they’ve shared in their sex life.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is very difficult for these partners to find a balance of passion, emotion and rational thinking. While Scorpio’s sexuality is hungry, deeply emotional and pervasive, Aquarius wants to be free of any boundaries and emotion, and will have real trouble being with a possessive partner. Their sex life can be like a battle arena, or like a wonderland, depending on the flexibility of both of them and the depth of emotions they share. As two fixed signs, they will most certainly have trouble changing their natures and adjusting to a partner that is too different from them."},"Trust":{"Value":1,"Description":"How on Earth is it possible for two honest and straightforward individuals such as Scorpio and Aquarius to have such a problem to trust each other? The problem here shows its face when they get too close. As soon as Scorpio starts to assume that Aquarius should be tamer and belong to them in a loving relationship, it will result in a forceful rebellion and the counterattack of their partner. Things could really get out of control if any sort of manipulation takes place, and unspoken tendencies might tear them apart in a matter of minutes."},"Intellect":{"Value":50,"Description":"For as long as they don’t give in to their stubborn, unmovable modes, these partners could have great conversations about all strange topics they can imagine. None of them will want to have small talk or discuss their day at work. It is futile from their perspective, and although Scorpio likes to be in control of everything their partner does, it will be refreshing to talk to someone who says unusual things. The biggest quality of their relationship is an incredible connection of depth and width in only one couple. They will both have trouble understanding our society as it is, and have certain similar perspectives on anything out of the ordinary.\\r\\n\\r\\nScorpio exalts Aquarius’ ruler and this is why their relationship is the possibility for both of them to grow. Not only will Scorpio adore the intellectual strength of their partner, but they will also help them understand the way their ideas might be realized through a feeling of ultimate possibility.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe weakest link in their relationship is their respect for each other, combined with their static natures. We would think that both of these signs are in connection to change and they couldn’t possibly be static, but in fact, they are static in their way of change, and their biggest challenge is to stop for a minute and treasure what they’ve found in each other."},"Emotions":{"Value":1,"Description":"If love happens between them, the most typical scenario is for Scorpio to fall into an obsessive mess of feelings towards their uninterested Aquarius partner. It takes a lot of work and commitment to reach the emotional core of Aquarius, and it is impossible to get there without spontaneity and trust. Scorpio can be spontaneous in situations that are free of emotions, but will rarely let their love for someone be a part of a maybe-yes-maybe-no swing controlled by their partner.\\r\\n\\r\\nAquarius will rarely tolerate or be with someone who tries to make them be more stable and down to earth, or anyone who quenches their desire to be free. As soon as they feel obligated to do anything, they will start pulling away and any emotion that might have been developing will suddenly be covered by the fear of commitment and the rut of everyday life.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they want to reach emotional balance, Scorpio has to be untied, realize that their partner will never belong to them and that they are free to leave anytime. They will have to understand that this relationship might end tomorrow and there is nothing they can do about it but accept it.

They will both like to take risks of any kind and their best date could be anything from parachute jumping to a night out in a casino. The best way for them to spend some quality time together is in some sort of intellectual activities and competitions, because this would allow them to manifest their possible hostility in a healthy way."},"Summary":{"Value":30,"Description":"Someone might say that this is a karmic relationship, that these partners were enemies in one of their previous lives and that they could fight until one of them falls dead. This would be a bit extreme though. The truth is, Scorpio is the sign of Uranus’ exaltation and as such, it adores Aquarius in a way. In most cases, Scorpio partner will show their affection obsessively, but this might actually feel good for Aquarius. When we look at the sign of Aquarius, we will see that it exalts Neptune, the ruler of a Water sign of Pisces, and all of our assumptions on their lack of emotionality will drown in their ultimate love.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fact is they are both in a way outcasts and rebels. While Scorpio represents all of our emotions we don’t want to deal with, Aquarius represents the way of thinking most of us are not ready for. It is best to look at them as announcers of change, for this is exactly what they will bring into each other’s lives."}},"Sagittarius":{"Love":{"Value":80,"Description":"Aquarius acts in a way Sagittarius thinks and this is quite an asset in their sex life. Their attraction can be strong, especially when a Sagittarius partner is at a crossroads in their life and need confirmation of their freedom and sexuality. Their sexual relationship will be very fun, because they both like to experiment and learn new things. Their communication will usually give them both so much satisfaction that sometimes they both almost won’t even need the act of sex in order to get satisfied.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough their sexual connection can be very satisfying for both partners, they could have trouble creating intimacy. Sagittarius partner will bring just enough warmth in their relationship, but the mutable quality of their sign will make them easily turn their focus to something else, while Aquarius partner still holds on to the same things. They will both understand the necessity of change and incorporate it in their sex life. Still, the emotional bond and consequentially the intimacy between them could get weak and strong, on and off, too often for both of them to see each other as perfect partners."},"Trust":{"Value":60,"Description":"They will sometimes know each other’s minds too well for them to create trust from the sense of absolute freedom. Sagittarius can be a sign prone to infidelity and Aquarius likes to be free to be available. With them both knowing these things about each other, they could easily start questioning if they should trust one another or not.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough they both find their relationships very dependent on the level of freedom they have, this is probably something they won’t be able to give to each other when they decide to commit to their romantic relationship. The best remedy for the lack of trust in any of the partners is for both of them to realize they their relationship is just something out of the ordinary, casual and free from any restraints."},"Intellect":{"Value":90,"Description":"When Sagittarius and Aquarius find a mutual interest, it becomes the infinite source of new topics, information and could even change their life philosophies. Aquarius partner can remain distant for a long time and Sagittarius might feel like a little child, talking excessively about uninteresting topics and trying to make a connection. When they finally point in the right direction and choose to speak of something that awakens Aquarian interest, their conversations will become incredible.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth of these partners are rational and give a lot of attention to their chain of thoughts. Both of them are fast enough in coming to different conclusions. The contact between them will spark their need for intellectual sparring and they could end up in some great debates. When they share a love for something, they will talk about it passionately, excessively and find new ideas and solutions to incorporate in their approach to this subject. The speed of Aquarius mixed with the passionate state of constant belief of Sagittarius, could make their relationship one of the most productive in the entire zodiac."},"Emotions":{"Value":85,"Description":"It is hard to set the scale for emotions in this relationship. None of these partners is that emotional on the surface, although Sagittarius can fall in and out of love quite often. It is a good thing that Sagittarius is so changeable, or they would have trouble keeping up with their Aquarius partner. Another good thing in this contact is the rational nature of both signs and their focus on mental processes. This will allow them to communicate about their emotions, whatever they are, without any sense of guilt or emotional pressure.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen their emotions start to build, it will take a long time before they are stable and both partners certain of their feelings for each other. Sagittarius will change their mind many times, probably going from one extreme to another because that is what they’re inspired to do by their Aquarius partner. On the other hand, Aquarius will need to form attachment first and then wait for the certainty of their partner’s love."},"Values":{"Value":90,"Description":"There is so many things they would agree on, starting from the usual – value of freedom, and moving on to their own qualities and expectations. They will both value wideness of one’s mind, the optimism and the faith behind the brains, intelligence and vision. As a sign of Neptune’s exaltation, Aquarius has a special approach to honesty, and for a Sagittarius honesty is one of the things they value most."},"Activities":{"Value":85,"Description":"There will be activities that Sagittarius will want to commit to, while Aquarius will find them silly or even stupid. They could have trouble reconciling their approach to religion and any religious activities could be the source of problems in their relationship, because their whole individual belief systems could be at stake. Still, in most situations they could have a lot of fun wherever they go.

There will probably be no place strange enough for these two to discover their shared interests once again."},"Summary":{"Value":83,"Description":"A relationship between a Sagittarius and an Aquarius partner might seem like a same sex friendship to other people and whatever they might think of this, this is the type of relationship both of these partners might need.

Their relationship is often a shiny beacon to everyone around them because it gives priority to the future and brings hope of a better time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main challenge of Sagittarius and Aquarius lies in their rational natures. Although their minds will have a wonderful relationship, they could have trouble reaching real intimacy and closeness. They both need to slow down and ask themselves how they feel before they end up in a heartless bond they find solace in as they run away from the world."}},"Capricorn":{"Love":{"Value":5,"Description":"It would be easy to make a simple assumption that Capricorn is traditional and restricting, while Aquarius is the opposite, but they are both traditionally ruled by the same planet and it would be silly not to understand their similarities. The main problem in their sex life will be their different pace, and this is mostly caused by the difference in their elements.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an Earth sign, Capricorn is slow and thorough. A representative of this sign will rarely jump into a sexual relationship without attraction and respect for another person, and will want to give their best performance when sex finally happens. Aquarius is an Air sign and this does make them kind of flaky and unreliable, although they are ruled by Saturn, the master of reliability. They will want things spontaneous and fast, without much thinking and as relaxed as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is very rare for an Aquarius to have patience to wait for Capricorn to make a detailed plan, and this will be a great turn off for Capricorn because they don’t like anything done in haste and the heat of the moment, especially when it comes to sex. They can both be very passionate when with the right partner, but the starting point in their approaches is usually simply too different to work out. Fortunately, the respect they will have for each other could make them become very good friends and if they manage to find the right way to communicate, they might even build a quality sexual relationship on a foundation of friendship."},"Trust":{"Value":80,"Description":"Why wouldn’t they trust one another? One of them has stone cold convictions and the need to never be wrong or make a mistake of any kind, while the other has no fear of confrontation and values the image of truth among the human race too much to have the desire to lie. Their ideas of trust are different though, and it will be hard for both of them to accept each other’s natures the way they were meant to be. The lack of trust between them is not really the lack of trust they have in each other, but in the possibility this kind of relationship will work out."},"Intellect":{"Value":65,"Description":"An intellectual relationship between a Capricorn and an Aquarius can be kind of painful to watch when you are, for example, a Taurus or a Cancer. They have this distant, cold, silent agreement that they are both worth each other’s respect and this can seem terrifying at times as they distance from each other in order to remain in this agreement. They would rather be in no relationship than look at each other in a different way, and because of this they could form a beautiful, lasting friendship.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, it is important to remember how different they are. Although there is no real freedom for Aquarius if the rules of their preceding sign aren’t followed, it is not easy for them to understand each other’s way of living. For as long as they hold on to shared interests and their mutual love for the seriousness of their bond, they will be able to maintain the image of a strong intellectual bond that makes them both satisfied."},"Emotions":{"Value":5,"Description":"The emotional side of a relationship between a Capricorn and an Aquarius is something really strange. In general interpretations they are both supposed to be unemotional, detached and closed up for emotional interaction with other people. However, this is not exactly the root of their lack of emotional connection.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an Earth sign, Capricorn needs emotions to be shown in a physical, practical way. This is exactly why they are often described as selfish, taking care only of their own needs. It is not easily accepted by the more spiritual signs that someone gives so much attention to earthly things such as money, or any material or career oriented value. Aquarius belongs to the element of Air and it is a sign of ultimate overall faith, different than any religion or rule that a human might have created. They need heavenly love, someone to share all of their ideas with, so they can float together on a cloud to Neverland. They will not care much about money, food or even sex, if their elevated spirit gets wings and they get yet another chance to dream. In order to form an emotional bond, both Capricorn and Aquarius will have to accept the other side of reality.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Values":{"Value":40,"Description":"Capricorn values boundaries and Aquarius values freedom. So how could they ever possibly be in a loving relationship? It is sometimes easy to forget that the sign of Capricorn precedes Aquarius and that there would be no sense of liberation without enough pressure. Their roles are intertwined in a strange way and they could find themselves valuing the exact same things if they dig into their personalities a bit deeper. To start with, they both value consistency and loyalty, and they will both consider all of the standard humane evaluations of people necessary. They will choose their relationships on the same grounds when it comes to long term commitments and rarely allow others to control them."},"Activities":{"Value":25,"Description":"None of these signs lacks energy. Capricorn exalts Mars and knows exactly where to drain it and Aquarius doesn’t really know what to do with it anyway. Even though they won’t often choose the same activities, this should help them follow each other for long enough to determine what they both might like. It is only necessary for Aquarius partner no to force, insist and speed up, and Capricorn needs not to inhibit, restrict and deny."},"Summary":{"Value":37,"Description":"Capricorn and Aquarius might not find each other that interesting to begin with. Both of these sings are traditionally ruled by Saturn, but their roles in the zodiac are entirely different. Their most challenging point in a relationship is their emotional contact. If they are to stay together, Capricorn partner will have to separate from the ground, just a little, and Aquarius will have to come a bit closer to Earth. They need to meet in the middle for Capricorn will be able to help Aquarius materialize their ideas, and Aquarius to be able to help Capricorn make the needed change in their life and turn to something new."}},"Aquarius":{"Love":{"Value":50,"Description":"Two Aquarius partners can have a very interesting sexual relationship, full of excitements and experimentation. They will fulfill each other’s fantasies without any repression, and easily find a language in which to connect their strange sexualities. Both of these partners will have trouble fitting in the usual stereotypes of sexuality and will rarely understand the usual taboos and restrictions other people tend to impose.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, they could find an obstacle in emotional bonding that could present itself through a general lack of intimacy in their sex life. This will not quench the desire they will feel when they are truly attracted to one another, but they could be too detached for any of the partners to give enough warmth or focus to their relationship. This is why as soon as the first excitement and attraction start to fade, and the need for true emotional contact emerges, they might have trouble staying together.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, if they are both looking for an occasional fling, this might be the best contact of signs in the entire zodiac to have one. There will be no better understanding for the sense of freedom and the need for the lack of intimacy as these two might have in certain conditions. Unfortunately, this is usually not enough to support their future together and they will both probably need someone they could love more and who would care about them in a different way."},"Trust":{"Value":99,"Description":"There is always an interesting bond between two representatives of the sign of Aquarius. They silently understand each other’s thoughts on a mental level that no other sign can reach. When they begin their relationship, their trust will be built on a foundation of freedom, so there will really be no reason for either of them to lie. If any of these partners becomes possessive, they will both be going against their beliefs if they decide to stay in this kind of relationship."},"Intellect":{"Value":75,"Description":"Wow. This is a conversation we would all like to be a part of. Aquarius is a sign of God’s voice and the image of the thoughts and reasoning of our higher selves. What one Aquarius tells to another might be something that only the two of them understand. Whatever their relationship might be like, when they talk, they will most certainly have an electrical connection and ideas will fly from side to side as if the conversation was their playground.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem in their intellectual contact can show up because of their ego issues and this is almost inevitable with two such strong individuals. The Sun represents our self-esteem, respect and individuality, and it is in its detriment in the sign of Aquarius. This could be the reason of a very unpleasant conflict between their personalities, for both of these partners have the need to set strong boundaries and easily get lost in their extreme individualities. The best cure for this situation is for each of them to slow down, breathe in, and ask themselves – do they really give each other enough freedom to be who they are?"},"Emotions":{"Value":40,"Description":"Aquarius isn’t that emotional in a typical sense, but this doesn’t mean they are not emotional at all. Their love is in a way shared on a group of people and although it is not that romantic, it is very important to them as the foundation of their entire belief system. When it comes to a romantic relationship, two Aquarius partners could feel a lot for each other, but are more likely to perceive each other as friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they do fall in love, as representatives of a fixed sign, they will stay together for a long time although none of them really cares for how long the relationship will last. The beauty of their love is in its detachment, however strange that may sound. Since they know it will never be found with another partner, they will only get closer as soon as true emotions start to show.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Values":{"Value":80,"Description":"It would be funny to assume that two members of the same sign have different values. But when we look at the sign of Aquarius we see that what they value is closely connected to their home and the way they were raised. As two rebellious, opinionated people, they need similar upbringing if they are to understand each other. The good thing is that they both value their freedom to extremes and this will connect them even when there are many other things they disagree on.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Activities":{"Value":99,"Description":"Maybe they are a bit selfish in the eyes of other people, but they won’t really think about it when they are together. They could go anywhere and do anything, for as long as it is interesting enough, educating enough or exciting enough. The best thing about a relationship between two Aquarius partners is that they can share extreme activities that other people don’t understand. So if one of them is into paragliding and the other into climbing Mount Everest, why wouldn’t they do these things together, one by one until all of their wishes come true?"},"Summary":{"Value":74,"Description":"It can be strange to imagine an Aquarius in love with another Aquarius. When you study Astrology, one of the first things you will learn is that Aquarius is the sign of divorces, breakups and setting free from regimes and relationships. As a sign that carries opposition within, they are often not easy to be with for any sign of the zodiac, but this is exactly something both of them could understand in each other. If they truly respect each other, there is a great chance they will learn to understand other things in each other’s lives too.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs crazy as it may sound, these two partners have a great chance of staying together because they will know each other better than anyone else could. However, they are rarely that attracted to each other, and even when they are, it is very difficult for them to form a deep emotional bond. When they do, well… the sky isn’t the limit."}},"Pisces":{"Love":{"Value":50,"Description":"The sign of Aquarius exalts Neptune, the ruler of Pisces. There is a strong link between these two signs, and in their sexual relationship, things will most certainly never get boring. At first glance, they don’t exactly go well together, one of them romantic, looking for their perfect love, while the other distant, looking for ways to set themselves free from all emotion. Still, their sex life can be quite amazing if Pisces don’t get too attached and find a way to keep their distance until their partner shows emotion.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a mutable sign, Pisces have an understanding for constant change and the exhilaration and the excitement of the act of sex. Aquarius will happily follow, with a little less enthusiasm because they are, after all, rational. The beauty of their sex life could be in creativity, a game of emotion and the everlasting questioning that will bring even more excitement and emotion to the entire relationship.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately, in many cases Pisces just want their emotions flow and they will end the relationship, rather than deal with constant disappointments. The best chance for a satisfying sex life between an Aquarius and a Pisces partner is in a scenario where Aquarius already had some emotions to share, before their relationship even started. They need a good starting point and the ability of Aquarius to show emotion from time to time in a way their partner will understand it.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Trust":{"Value":50,"Description":"Trust is the most important issue for this couple and it can go from one extreme to another. Depending on the state of their intimacy, they could end up covered in lies or completely free of them. Aquarian nature can be a bit aggressive from time to time and their personal rebellious needs don’t actually help Pisces feel secure enough to share intimate thoughts. The potential emotional dependency of Pisces can make Aquarius partner give in to their perfect lying skills in order to feel freer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only way they can build unconditional trust is to use their ability to feel each other’s true core. If Pisces understand the soft side of Aquarius, the one that lies far beneath the surface, they won’t run from telling the truth. When intimacy is found, Aquarius will finally be able to stop running away from commitment and the problem with the lack of freedom will be automatically solved."},"Intellect":{"Value":35,"Description":"They can dream well together, but unfortunately they will hardly ever make any dreams come true. The lack of reality in their relationship could hurt them both and they might not even know where the problem hides, while they feel frustrated by their relationship. The sign of Pisces should be able to ground Aquarius partner’s ideas because their element is closer to earth. However, they often get lost on their way to do anything real, especially when they don’t feel it is in the path of their own mission.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe understanding between them doesn’t always go very deep and although they can have a lot of fun together, they will have different approaches to the same things that interest them. For example, if they start talking about religion, they will end up in a philosophy battle that has no real value. By the end of it, Pisces will feel bad because they even tried to rationalize their faith, and Aquarius will feel like they have been talking to a foggy image of something resembling an opinion."},"Emotions":{"Value":1,"Description":"Aquarius is distant and impersonal while Pisces can’t wait to get tied to someone from their fairytale love. Their relationship could be exhausting for Pisces partner if they try too hard to find the response for the feelings they might have. The distance of their partner will most certainly exalt them and create a special emotional rollercoaster for Pisces that could lead straight to disappointment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey could make a safe emotional environment for each other only if the initiative comes from Aquarius partner alone. Pisces would have to be completely silent, uninvolved, feminine and reactive. As soon as idealization appears, the fine balance will be shaken and the sense of freedom for Aquarius will be disturbed."},"Values":{"Value":50,"Description":"The link between these signs simply doesn’t let them get too far from one another and their values will mostly be the same, but entirely different in their realization. They will both value freedom of any kind, love for humankind, excitement, change, inspiration and their ideas and dreams. For Aquarius, this love for humankind would mean absolute justice, equality and freedom of speech. For Pisces, it would mean the eternal sound of the ocean as a blessing bringing us here. If we apply this significant character difference to all other things they value together, we will see that they will need a lot of deep understanding to mend their differences."},"Activities":{"Value":40,"Description":"It is a good thing that the sign of Pisces is always open for change, because Aquarius will gladly provide some. Their interests can be quite similar and with certain compromises they could find a lot to do together. Pisces will gladly visit an art show, but why not make it a modern one so Aquarius could be interested as much? Their problem is in the perception of romance and disagreements on things couples should do together. Pisces partner will want unusual, surprising and exciting things, but followed with romance, physical pleasure and deep emotional understanding. Aquarius partner, on the other hand, will want inspiring conversations, intellectual stimulation and preferably some extreme activities included."},"Summary":{"Value":38,"Description":"As all neighboring signs, Aquarius and Pisces don’t necessarily have the best understanding of each other’s personalities. However, the sign of Aquarius exalts Neptune, the ruler of Pisces, and this gives them a strong bond through the planet of all magic. It is not easy to create the fairytale version of this contact, but once they find the emotional balance and the one, core truth to each other, they will have no problem keeping their fairytale alive, day after day."}}},"Pisces":{"Aries":{"Love":{"Value":20,"Description":"Aries and Pisces are two signs that really have trouble connecting. The beginning of all things lies at 0° of Aries and their end at 29° of Pisces. Their connection is like a “little death” making room for all that is new, untamed and inexperienced. It is hard for them to bond, as much as it is hard for all of us to transcend, go beyond our physical body and be one with the Universe. With that said, it is understandable how difficult it is for their sexual natures to accept one another.\\r\\n\\r\\nAries stands for instinctive sex. The sign of Pisces stands for orgasm. Although Aries cares about their orgasm, they will not make an art out of it. Pisces would rather satisfy themselves than be with someone who doesn’t understand the art of orgasms. When they end up together, it can be torture for both, because they just don’t understand what each of them needs. Aries would even have some success in understanding the need for tenderness and physical touch, but what Pisces want is like an unreachable wonderland that no one needs. In fact, they simply don’t understand what it is they need. Aries looks like an inexperienced child to their Pisces partner, and although this can open the door for Pisces to enter this relationship, it does not feel that good when they realize that this is not about to change.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they are both open enough to find their intimate language, their sex life has to be weird and kinky if they want to succeed. Pisces will feel suffocated in anything ordinary and less satisfying than what they know they deserve, while Aries is usually not very interested in sharing emotions all night long and waking up in the afternoon."},"Trust":{"Value":1,"Description":"With Aries holding their head high, their attractive, straightforward attitude and their libido, it is not easy for sensitive Pisces not to pick up those signals emitted all around. This will immediately give effect to the degree of their confidence. It is hard to open up when you don’t trust your partner, so Pisces will stay in their little world for as long as they can, only to avoid being hurt and lied to. Aries will see their partner’s world as a phony, unclear image that there is no need for, and find their Pisces partner shady and unworthy of their trust."},"Intellect":{"Value":70,"Description":"Aries and Pisces could find many things to talk about if they open up for each other’s support and advice. Although they are interested in entirely different things most of the time, they are still connected as neighboring signs and have a way of leaning on each other. Through their relationship they need to learn about their own weaknesses and how to mend them to be complete. It is not exactly as they complete each other, but the effect they have on each other can be like the correct medicine.\\r\\n\\r\\nAries has a tendency not to look behind, question the past, or be too sharp and fast for their relationships. They could also have an ego with a shotgun, waiting for any potential partner to pass by and kill their desire to even think about dating an Aries, let alone be serious about a relationship with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nPisces are sensitive enough to explain to Aries how they should soften up but keep their boundaries strong. Pisces represent a dream land of Aries and they are able to show them that they could actually have a mission and a higher purpose, instead of just chasing through life.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn return, Aries partner will help their Pisces partner find their grounding. They will not be that gentle about it, that is guaranteed, but could be realistic just enough to show Pisces how important it is to have initiative and build something you dream about in the real world. If they start their intimate relationship on these foundations, they could easily discover their middle ground for other segments of their relationship.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn case they are not so open to change and are not in search of someone to help them create, they will hardly share many topics they both find interesting."},"Emotions":{"Value":5,"Description":"Their emotional worlds are like two different planets that rule their signs – Mars and Neptune. While Mars, the ruler of Aries, is covered in rust, a red colored desert with volcanoes, canyons and weather, Neptune is a blue gas giant, cold, whipped by winds and much farther from the Sun. This is exactly how their emotions differ. Those that Aries cherish most are well defined, strong, protected, and colored in a color of passion. Pisces on the other hand, have a windy and changeable emotional world, colored blue like the color of sadness and vision, and are easily cooled down as soon as they feel disappointment."},"Values":{"Value":35,"Description":"It is strange how they both value honesty and have such trust barriers when they get together. When they get involved, trust becomes something like a sole purpose of their entire relationship.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey will also both like fairytale heroes and value the usual pride, chastity and bravery scenario. Still, the core of these values is different for the two of them. Aries representatives will value them because of that sense of strength, power and because of the role of that one and only hero, smarter and braver than everyone else. Pisces value them for their ideals, happy endings and those utopian relationships between those few worthy men and women."},"Activities":{"Value":40,"Description":"They could share a walk in the forest, or engage in water sports. Other activities that Aries would gladly take on are not “spiritual” enough for Pisces. Pisces always need to have “a second perspective” and this can seem crazy to their Aries partner. Yes, Pisces partner knows that sports are healthy, but they need to attach them to something from their infinite world. So water sports are fine, because of all the secrets of the water, the view of the ocean, being underwater and contemplating on the purpose of life, or a dive in the pool. Walk in the forest can be beautiful because they can hear the birds, trees saying “hello” and wait for two owls to rest on their shoulders. In the world of Aries, things are really so much simpler and if they want to enjoy something, they will simply go and enjoy. In the same manner, they would run when they run, practice when they practice and watch the ocean when they watch the ocean."},"Summary":{"Value":29,"Description":"This is a relationship disturbed mostly by the lack of trust and the ability of both parties to open up to their partner. Aries is ruled by Mars, the planet that rules our first chakra, responsible for our ability to set good boundaries. Pisces is ruled by Neptune, in charge of our entire aura and our permeability for outside stimuli. Since they are both responsible for our border with the outside world, it is hard to say which partner should loosen up and make it possible for them to come close. Their only chance of a happy ending is if Aries partner dives in and their Pisces partner wakes up.\\r\\n\\r\\n"}},"Taurus":{"Love":{"Value":99,"Description":"Taurus and Pisces are both all about pleasure. Taurus represents the art of love making, tenderness and sensuality. The sign of Pisces is a culmination of a sexual encounter – orgasm. This is a place where Venus is exalted, magical, mysterious and unbelievably satisfying for Taurus’ ruler. They have the ability to get lost in each other, make their dreams come true and satisfy each other by pure existence.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it comes to sex, Taurus can easily end up in a rut if their partner isn’t inspiring or creative enough. They don’t even care, for as long as their emotional needs are met and their physical body respected. Pisces on the other hand, get lost in sexual experiences, and can even find them toxic if their impressions on other people are unrealistic. When they meet the right Taurus partner, they can be intrigued and relieved by their nature, for what they see is actually what they get.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of the emotional nature of the sign of Pisces and their deep sense of purpose, Taurus will feel loved to the point of getting lost in the sexuality of their partner. They will both pay very little attention to their own pleasure because of all those feelings guiding them. This is almost always a giving relationship where both partners are equally satisfied when it comes to sex."},"Trust":{"Value":80,"Description":"Because of the Pisces’ tendency to enter each relationship with an idealistic approach, there is a great chance they will open up to their Taurus partner as soon as they realize how stable and secure they seem. The beauty of their contact is in the fact that when together, they both lose their need to hide and let their emotions grow with ease.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sign of Pisces is a sign of mutable quality, and they can unexpectedly change, without a clear reason. If this happens, Taurus will know that the trust is lost, however their relationship seemed just a couple of minutes ago. It is a deep sense of broken intimacy, lost in the Pisces’ need for emotional exhilaration. Basically, when Pisces partner gets bored, they start to think of excuses and lies, before they even realize that their relationship is over. It is up to Taurus to understand the flakiness of their partner. When they do, they can either accept the situation and fight for love, or end the relationship and move on.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Intellect":{"Value":95,"Description":"Taurus and Pisces probably won’t have the need to talk much. Instead, they will understand each other through all types of nonverbal communication, curious about each other’s next movement. Subtlety of Pisces is something truly inspiring for Taurus and they will feel the need to get to know every detail in their partner’s behavior. Both of these signs are not very talkative and Pisces even lead Mercury to its fall. This is why they really need to form a strong emotional bond and listen to each other through very little words.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat field of talent and creative energy that Pisces carries along goes well with Taurus’ need for beauty. Unfortunately, they can get lost in the world of Pisces and really lose that grip they have on reality. At first, this will be like a drug, an addiction, something they have been waiting for their entire life. As time goes by, the feeling will not be this good, for they will lose touch with themselves and have a feeling they don’t know who they are anymore. The most important thing for Taurus in a relationship with Pisces is to stand their ground and hold on to their common sense, practicality and their usual need to live in reality."},"Emotions":{"Value":99,"Description":"Taurus and Pisces have a magical emotional connection. For as long as Pisces don’t change their mind and swim off, their relationship should be filled with love and wonder. With Pisces exalting Venus, the ruler of Taurus, this is not only love but adoration. Taurus will feel, for however long, like the center of someone’s world, loved and cherished to the point of unbearable beauty. If this feeling goes on, they could stay in a beautiful relationship for a very long time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as Pisces partner feels this beautiful emotion dying down, they will make a spontaneous maneuver to distance themselves from their Taurus partner. The funny thing is that in most cases Taurus won’t be hurt at all. That simple feel of inadequacy will be enough for both of them to let distance take its course. Even though Taurus has a tendency to get emotionally bound to their partner, their potential separation from Pisces will be as coming back to reality more than a devastating event."},"Values":{"Value":85,"Description":"Taurus is turned to a material reality and Pisces to an emotional one.

No other sign of the zodiac can truly understand the way these two value love, especially when they are in love with each other."},"Activities":{"Value":70,"Description":"The main problem these signs will run into is in the fact that Taurus is a fixed sign and Pisces mutable. This can lead to a lack of understanding when it comes to the way they want to spend their time together. At first, they will enjoy the same things, but Pisces partner will get bored very soon if the scenery doesn’t change. It is not like them to stay in one place for too long. When Taurus is found in a beautiful situation, they will want to stay in it forever, holding on to the first image even when the beauty of it fades. This will slow down all movement and could really annoy their Pisces partner.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Summary":{"Value":88,"Description":"This is a relationship based on love and full of it while it lasts. They both crave romance and beauty in their lives, and will do anything that is needed to keep the beauty going between them. Taurus will give their Pisces partner a chance to connect to the real world, showing them how to ground their creativity, while Pisces will lift up Taurus and make them a bit softer and more flexible. They seem to be on a mission of convincing them that true love exists. When their relationship is over, they will both know it instantly and very often a conversation about a breakup would be redundant. If they savor their trust and nurture the beauty of love they share, their relationship can last and be as inspiring as a dream coming true.\\r\\n\\r\\n"}},"Gemini":{"Love":{"Value":15,"Description":"It is a good thing there is so much creativity to Gemini’s approach to sex, or they would really have difficulty making any sort of intimate connection with Pisces. They can be attracted to each other due to the fact that they are ruled by Mercury and Jupiter, the same planets that rule their opposing signs. Still, there is a big chance they won’t even recognize each other as sexual beings or keep a distance from each other if they do.\\r\\n\\r\\nGemini has a lot of creative potential, but isn’t exactly in search for their one and only true love in order to have sex. Pisces, on the other hand, exalt Venus, and they only want to have sex with the love of their life, unless they’ve been disappointed too many times. If they meet after these numerous disappointments, Gemini will not find Pisces very attractive, for they will no longer have any childish energy or charm.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf their sex life is supposed to be functional, both of them will have to find a way to be a bit more grounded than they normally are. Gemini will have to realize the truth behind their own emotional nature and give in to true intimacy, while Pisces will have to accept the differences of their partner instead of searching for a soulmate with predefined qualities."},"Trust":{"Value":1,"Description":"Trust is already a weak spot in almost every relationship these two can have and when they get together, there is a chance they will have no idea how to create any trust between them. They have completely different ways of dealing with their emotional relationships and their issues with self-image, and they will think of many different ways to bend the truth when they are together. Unfortunately, when any of them lies, they won’t have much success. Gemini is too smart to be lied to by their Pisces partner, and Pisces sense their Gemini partner’s state too well to not realize when they’re not telling the truth. Basically they both dip into each other’s unconscious and see each other in the way that none of them looks at themselves.\\r\\n"},"Intellect":{"Value":20,"Description":"There is always a fairytale or two to share between them and some fun to have when they go out. They will laugh together, but this is a strange connection with a lack of real communication. Gemini can decide to make a joke and Pisces will laugh without really thinking about it. Pisces will then say something to poke their Gemini and Gemini will laugh without thinking about it. It is as if they never really listen to each other and sink into a strange pool of superficial relationships and small talk.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they start discussing their deep thoughts and feelings, they might end up in a conflict that none of them anticipated. We could say that they idealize each other, but only to a point of recognition. Neither Gemini nor Pisces will think of each other as their one true love unless they really are each other’s one true love. So they will have this image of each other that is deviated from reality, due to the fact they don’t really listen to each other. The only possible way for them to have a conversation with depth is in a situation in which they have absolute emotional intimacy, such as family members usually have."},"Emotions":{"Value":1,"Description":"Gemini is one of the most rational signs in the zodiac and Pisces is the cureless romantic and one of the most emotional signs. When they do fall in love, they are rarely on the same frequency and often only one of them has true emotions for the other. They represent ideal candidates for an unreturned love scenario and can be a nuisance to everyone around them if they end up in a relationship with no emotional balance."},"Values":{"Value":5,"Description":"They both value what they stand for and although Gemini values someone to listen to them and love them unconditionally, this is not the same as the passionate love Pisces partner wants to have. In general, they will both hold on to what they know best and Gemini will value intellectual strength and won’t get very disturbed by dishonesty for as long as their image of a relationship isn’t disturbed. Pisces will value their partner’s reliability and trust is very high on their list of priorities.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, there is one thing they will share, hidden in the fact that they both value someone’s ability to create. Even though this comes out of different views on creation, it can bond them in the act of creativity. Pisces would provide talent and inspiration and Gemini their resourcefulness and practicality."},"Activities":{"Value":15,"Description":"When we speak of Gemini and Pisces, we have to keep in mind that both signs are mutable. Although their interests might differ greatly, they could find activities to share due to their mutual need for movement of any kind. Pisces will normally dream about movement rather than actually move and this is exactly what their Gemini could teach them – how to make the first step."},"Summary":{"Value":10,"Description":"Gemini and Pisces are squaring signs that often don’t have that much in common. They are both usually positive enough to have a superficial enjoyable relationship and go well together at large social gatherings. They could both forget to call each other when they agreed to, and they can both change their opinions in two seconds, but they simply don’t share the same goals. As a strongly mental and a strongly emotional sign, their lack of understanding can be hurtful for Pisces and sometimes for both of them. If they do fall in love and start a romantic relationship, chances are they will not last very long.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, there is a beauty in the creative side of this relationship and if Gemini decides to truly listen to Pisces, they could help them use their talent in a constructive way. In most situations Pisces will just drain the energy out of their Gemini partner, especially if they end up in their fragile, needy mode that some other signs could understand much better than Gemini. If they are to succeed in their persistence to be together, they should work together and socialize a lot. The most important thing for both of them in this relationship is to reach for their emotional cores and give in to true intimacy, or they will never manage to communicate."}},"Cancer":{"Love":{"Value":85,"Description":"Cancer and Pisces are almost always brought together by a romantic love. Their sexual connection is usually primarily emotional. Pisces partner might seem a bit weird and kinky to Cancer, but they should have a feel for each other, strong enough for both of them to enrich their sexual relationship with their own quality.\\r\\n\\r\\nCancer will bring intimacy into their sex life and the meaning behind the act. They will nurture their partner and care about their pleasure, giving them a stable and a safe approach to a healthy sex life. Pisces will bring in change, creativity, inspiration and probably a lot of sensuality due to the fact that this is the sign that exalts Venus. The beauty of this connection is in the emotion they share and the way they cherish each other and respect each other’s sensitivity.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir main problem might arise because Cancer can be somewhat traditional when it comes to sex and Pisces partner doesn’t really understand this. Pisces’ need to connect and feel love is larger than any sort of rule humankind might have made for love. However, in most cases they will be tender enough to inspire their Cancer partner to let go of their rigid attitudes and shame, and give in to the beauty of sexual exchange of emotions.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Trust":{"Value":70,"Description":"It is a good thing that Cancer is usually not aggressive or pushy, or they could easily get dishonesty from Pisces as a response to their tendency to create intimacy and a happy home at any cost. Pisces don’t really understand marriage except as a part of a fairytale ending or because of all that lace, and Cancer will usually want a wedding as a crowning of a loving relationship. This could be recognized as pressure to some point and this could lead to Pisces partner getting scared.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Pisces get scared, they somehow fail to tell the truth even on silly things in their life, because they feel the need to distance themselves from any pressure they might feel. It is a good thing that Cancer understands this and easily separates lies from intimacy. Whatever the situation, they will both probably be patient enough to have just enough trust in one another for their relationship to work out.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Intellect":{"Value":85,"Description":"As changeable as Pisces are, they always have something to talk about. This can be inspiring or irritating to Cancer who would maybe rather deal with “real information”. Usually they communicate just fine, but there are situations in which they could float away on an idea made out of words. Cancer is looking for someone with clarity on the use and the practicality of everything they mention. Pisces is everything but focused on practicality in most everyday situations.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Pisces partner learns to be more silent, relying on their feelings, and starts fighting for what they wish for, they could sweep their Cancer off their feet. Unfortunately, their entire relationship will not last very long if only words are spoken but deeds don’t follow. Cancer’s opposing sign is after all – Capricorn, and they need a partner able to constructively use things, situations and emotions."},"Emotions":{"Value":99,"Description":"Cancer can understand the sensitive nature of their Pisces partner better than anyone else. Everything that seems easygoing and positive might have a hidden negative note in the Pisces world, and Cancer feels rather than listens, which makes them a perfect companion for someone like Pisces. When they sense this deep understanding, Pisces partner will return the favor by absolute tenderness and finally open up to their Cancer partner. When they find this shared point of intimacy where true emotions are shared, this will affect all other segments of their relationship and be a fuel for it to have a fairytale ending."},"Values":{"Value":25,"Description":"This is where the difference in their character really comes to focus. As much as they will both value being loved and cared for, Cancer will value a stable emotional situation and a cozy home to come to, while Pisces will probably value any chance for an emotional rollercoaster more. It is often said that Pisces idealize partners and different things in life, but in fact they get depressed when there is no magic and perfect beauty surrounding them. If their day to day life with a Cancer partner becomes anything similar to a boring routine, they will find a way to run off, find a lover or create any sort of truly exciting circumstances."},"Activities":{"Value":70,"Description":"When they meet and start their relationship, they will probably have a lot of things to do together. A relationship with a Pisces partner is always exciting and inspirational, and Cancer will give it strength, stability and roots. At the beginning, this may seem like a great arrangement, but in time, Pisces might want too much activity for what Cancer partner really needs. This wouldn’t be much of a problem if they would say this to their partner without fear of any one of them getting hurt. If they start bending the truth, Cancer will feel their trust beginning to fade and this could begin a series on problems between them, that could have been easily avoided."},"Summary":{"Value":72,"Description":"As two Water signs, Cancer and Pisces connect through emotions, usually as soon as they lay eyes on each other. This is one of the typical combinations of zodiac signs for love at first sight. Their main challenge is hidden in the changeable nature of the sign of Pisces, not because it is there, but because they might fear to show it. Their biggest problem lies in the fact that they give priority to different types of love in their life. If passion and sensual, sexual love isn’t there, Pisces will rarely be satisfied with the love they get from their family, and Cancer would find a life without a family nest very depressing. A fine balance needs to be made between excitement and stability, and they could be one of the most wonderful couples of the zodiac – Cancer inspired and Pisces with a feel of home."}},"Leo":{"Love":{"Value":1,"Description":"It is incredible how two signs that represent love, can be so wrong for each other. Leo will seem like a brute, caring selfishly about their own needs, incapable of forming an intimate relationship with anyone, let alone Pisces. Although this is not true, it might be the obvious reality to Pisces if they end up in a relationship with Leo Partner. In return, Leo will think of Pisces as weak and unrealistic, completely separated from their own desires and the strength of their body or emotions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe truth is, they can both be incredible lovers but they will rarely discover this together. Their roles and characters seem to be too different for them to find a way to coexist in a satisfying sexual relationship. The main problem of their relationship is in the fact that the sign of Leo is a sign of the fall of Pisces’ ruler, Neptune. In a practical sense, this means that Leo will burst the bubble of Pisces and endanger their sensitivity, idealism and go against their beliefs. This will ruin the romance between them and make it impossible for them to find any magic while they are together.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeo’s openness and directness will make Pisces feel ashamed and rushed, and their sex life could be delayed indefinitely until Pisces partner feels secure enough to get naked. Because of differences in their approach to sex, Leo will in most cases seem like an insensitive brute, unless Pisces start understanding their emotional depth even though it is so different from theirs. The best way for these partners to find a language that can sustain their sex life is by building emotional trust first and worrying about sexual satisfaction later."},"Trust":{"Value":1,"Description":"Neptune is a planet of all deceit and mistrust in the world, making things around us seem foggy, unclear and fake. Pisces is the sign ruled by Neptune, and Leo brings it to its fall. This is a difficult combination of signs to reach a point of mutual trust. They will both seem dishonest to one another, not because they lie, but because their characters seem unreal. Leo will think of Pisces as if they were always on drugs, and Pisces will feel sorry for Leo and their lack of faith."},"Intellect":{"Value":35,"Description":"Ideals Pisces have could be shattered by the approach of Leo if they get too close to one another. They could share many interests due to the creative power of both signs. Pisces will easily give inspiration to Leo, but the problem is in the way Leo might use it. The best way for them to create a safe surrounding for both partners, is to stick to the subject they are individually interested in.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeo is a warm sign, very passionate about their doings and their desires. Pisces will rarely show the same initiative to realize any of their dreams and this is their greatest difference. Since Leo always shines a light on our virtues and shortcomings, they will not miss a chance to show their Pisces partner how unrealistic they are. This could help Pisces build a more realistic approach, but it could also affect their confidence and hurt them through a difficult perception of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Emotions":{"Value":15,"Description":"Both of these individuals are extremely emotional, each in their own way. The Fire element Leo belongs to, makes them passionate and gives them the need to fight for their loved one and their emotions. Pisces is a Water sign, and much more passive, showing their passion through the flow of emotion. They will rarely fight for anything, convinced that perfection doesn’t need fighting for and that real treasures are spontaneous and free of conflict.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe middle point for these partners is in their realization that not everything needs to be won, as much as not everything should be uninfluenced. Although true emotions are supposed to develop without difficulty, sometimes life is testing us to see if we really care. Still, this is not something that happens all the time, and sometimes things need to be let go because they don’t belong to us, and we don’t belong to them."},"Values":{"Value":20,"Description":"It is interesting how much both of these partners will value clarity and honesty. Pisces partner understands the necessity of lies, but still lives for clarity of the mind and the realization of their true inner Self. A great link between their worlds of values is in Leo’s heroic nature that seems to have roots in a fairytale of Pisces. As much as they will both value their individual set of beliefs, they will be able to find middle ground in the grandiose character of Leo and the idealizing nature of Pisces.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Activities":{"Value":10,"Description":"As a fixed and a mutable sign, they will have trouble synchronizing their need for changes and new activities. Although Leo is a Fire sign, always ready to start something new, they will like to stick to their routine and show themselves in all the usual places every day. Pisces want to be invisible and they will change the scenery often in order for people not to recognize them. Although they could share some interests and have activities they would like to share, they will rarely stick to the same place and same actions together for very long."},"Summary":{"Value":14,"Description":"Leo and Pisces seem to be put on this Earth to spread entirely different kinds of love. The problem isn’t in their element or their quality, as much as it is in their connection through the fall of Neptune, the ruler of Pisces. If they get attracted to each other, they will be subjected to the risk of great damage to their beliefs, their inner faith and usually succumb to mutual disrespect because of a simple lack of understanding. The beauty of their relationship could be developed through the fairytale approach of Pisces, if they build the heroic image of their Leo partner to the point in which other differences between them fade."}},"Virgo":{"Love":{"Value":99,"Description":"Virgo and Pisces are opposing signs and their attraction is very strong. Since they also represent the axis of Venus’ fall and exaltation, we can conclude that their relationship always has a lesson on Venus to teach. These partners have a task to find the place of physical intimacy in which they will both be relaxed to be exactly who they are.\\r\\n\\r\\nVirgo partner will usually be shy, trying to show their sexuality through rational behavior, and Pisces will see right through this. On the other hand, Pisces will fear close physical connection with another person, and this will be practically dismissed by Virgo. As they both learn that they cannot hide who they are, they will have no choice but to set themselves free from any fear and shame, giving in to the wonderful sexual experience Venus has to offer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a couple that will never have instinctive sex, however passionate they might get. Virgo’s analytical mind wouldn’t allow for them to act “like animals”, and this is something that Pisces will find so humanlike and attractive. Virgo will mostly be attracted by the purity of sex with Pisces, who truly approach it as an act of love, free from prejudice and following their inner feeling, wherever it leads."},"Trust":{"Value":65,"Description":"Virgo can have some serious trust issues that Pisces won’t actually help them overcome. In order to have a healthy relationship in which they both trust each other, they will both need to be secure and confident enough to be honest. Both of these partners will easily give in to dishonesty, although their convictions are the opposite of their behavior. It can be torture for both of them if any one of the partners tells a lie. Fortunately, they are both aware that some secrecy might even spark their relationship and give it more passion. This is why they will usually get over small intimacy outbreaks in order to trust each other on a higher level."},"Intellect":{"Value":85,"Description":"They complement each other best through communication and intellectual stimulation. When they start their relationship, they are bound to realize how similar they actually are, even though they seem so different. The mutable quality of their signs will allow them to jump from topic to topic, both of them staying interested in the flow and the outcome of their conversations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best person to pull Virgo out of their obsessive analysis is Pisces, with their smile and their wider picture. Pisces will give their Virgo partner faith, teach them how belief can form reality and help them be free from too much caution and fear from failure. Virgo often has this inner battle in which nothing they know, think or do is good or valuable enough. Pisces are able to inspire and find value in everything in life, and those insecurities and emotional problems of Virgo may seem like something needless that damages the self-esteem of everyone around them. They will do their best to help their partner reach the point of inner security in which they understand their worth. In return, Virgo will help Pisces reach the actual materialization of their incredible talents. They might do so through nagging and constant criticism, but in the end, Pisces will have many things to be thankful for.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot only does this relationship represent the axis of Venus’ exaltation and fall, but it also represents the axis of the exaltation and fall of Mercury. As much as Virgo has trouble with Venus, Pisces have trouble with practical Mercury and their mind can send mixed signals making them lost and confused. Virgo will help them build an inner sense of intellectual security, in return for their emotional one."},"Emotions":{"Value":95,"Description":"There is no other sign in the zodiac that can awaken the emotional depths of Virgo better than Pisces. Understanding between them could reach points of perfection and this is something that both of them will probably be unable to find with anyone else. Still, it is important for them not to build too much expectation around this idea of perfection, for no one can meet these requirements in real life.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they go astray, losing touch with their partner’s true personality, they will easily get disappointed and have the need to end their relationship. With two mutable signs everything moves fast and changes are inevitable.

This makes them partners with greatest challenges and the greatest potential for love in the entire zodiac.

In many cases this is not a couple that will last very long, as their mutable quality makes them changeable enough to disregard the entire relationship quickly if they aren’t satisfied.

However, we shouldn’t forget their connection through Venus, the ruler of Libra, exalted in Pisces. Since they touch each other through this sensual, loving planet, they might find true sexual satisfaction together. They can both be selfless lovers, caring more about the satisfaction of their partner than their own.\\r\\n\\r\\nTenderness shouldn’t be an issue here for none of these partners will like too much aggression and roughness anyway. They could discover many different sexual preferences that they weren’t aware of before, through a connection of very different natures. If they weren’t connected by Venus, it would be very difficult for them to form a relationship on any kind, for their approach to life and sexuality is completely different.\\r\\n\\r\\nLibra partner wants someone strong, passionate and confident, while Pisces partner wants someone gentle, compassionate and aware of their feelings.

The rest of their characters will differ greatly and while Libra will value consistency and stability, Pisces will value spontaneity and one’s ability to follow their heart.

They will manage to find activities they will both like, and if nothing else works they can always turn to any sort of art.

Scorpio is a sign that represents sex, as well as sexual repression, and depending on the upbringing and previous sexual experiences, they can be a bit rough on their sensitive Pisces partner. On the other hand, Pisces is a sign of orgasms, strange sexual experiences and all of the sexual weirdness. If they understand the emotional depth of Scorpio, they might be much more resilient than we would assume.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe biggest challenge for these partners is their relation to Venus, the planet of sensual physical satisfaction. Scorpio doesn’t care for Venus very much, leading it to its detriment, while Pisces adore it through exaltation. This can be very unfortunate if Scorpio dismisses this emotional need of Pisces to be satisfied and loved at the same time.

Both of these signs are linked to different types of magic, and they will both be interested in the “behind the scenes” view on everything that surrounds them.

This is not a consequence of a lack of initiative, but rather their own need to stay in the bubble of emotional perfection and their fear of bursting this bubble by forming a physical relationship that requires dealing with physical imperfections.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they begin a physical relationship, they could both be too cautious on choices of sexual activity they will suggest to each other. Their relationship might strangely inhibit them both, because of the possibility of unrealistic expectations and the fear of being let down.

The problem here is in the fact that they are too alike and they will wake each other’s deficiencies through mere existence. This will lead to misunderstandings and the conviction of both partners that they don’t value the same things. Not because their values differ that much, but because their priorities might be different."},"Activities":{"Value":75,"Description":"They will most certainly have a lot of fun. Two Pisces partners cannot ever be bored. Their relationship will be satisfying to all their senses, and they will spend many romantic nights, as well as exciting days, in each other’s arms. That is, if they ever manage to meet. While one of them might appear at the agreed point in time, the other will get lost, miss a turn, or show up at their previous meeting point. When they finally manage to find each other, with many hours of delay, they might move in opposite directions and be unaware of that due to the fact they didn’t talk to begin with. In general, their shared activities are dependent very much on their physical contact, because if they have it, at least they could hold hands not to get lost."},"Summary":{"Value":73,"Description":"This is a relationship of two kindred spirits that often doesn’t last very long. At first, it will be challenging for them to leave the platonic zone and start building a physical relationship. Once they get close to each other, their process of learning will begin and both partners will be fascinated by each other, thinking that their relationship could never end. They will easily idealize each other, think of their relationship as the perfect love, but this infatuation won’t last very long because of their changeable natures. The fact is their relationship represents a moment in time when they have both deserved to smile. For as long as it lasts and they are happy, it will be cherished by both of them.\\r\\n\\r\\n"}},"Capricorn":{"Love":{"Value":99,"Description":"There is probably no better way for a Capricorn to relax, than to enter a relationship with a Pisces partner. Their sexual relationship is a contact of two powerful individuals, one of them extremely strict and rational, and another flexible and emotional but confident about their beliefs. Differences between them will create a strong attraction, almost as if they were opposing signs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sex life these partners can share is unexplainable when their characters are superficially observed. But in a different way than a Cancer, Pisces can reach emotional depth of Capricorn by a simple feel. This is not a matter of compassion, but a matter of their deep inner truths. Capricorn isn’t unemotional, however obvious their coldness might be, and Pisces can be quite rational, even though they seem lost in emotion. They can awaken the best qualities in each other and share strong intimacy through deep emotionally-rational understanding.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir sex life will move in a strangely spontaneous way. Capricorn will be inspired to let go and open up to their partner, while Pisces will easily ground their affections and find a way to show them through physical contact. Capricorn will feel more casual and Pisces will start to gather themselves up. If they stay together for long enough, they could make a perfect blend of stability, trust and emotional excitement."},"Trust":{"Value":85,"Description":"They will often understand each other well enough to respect their relationship and keep it clear of dishonesty. This is not always the case, and the possible roughness of Capricorn can sometime induce Pisces to tell a lie or two. On the other hand, if Capricorn is closed up and unreachable, trust will be disturbed by a simple fact that they don’t know each other that well at all. The beauty of their relationship is in their approach to trust when they realize who they are dealing with. Since both of the partners don’t trust the world to open up easily, they will have to earn it, day by day, from each other. This might seem like a game or a competition to win over the trust of their partner."},"Intellect":{"Value":65,"Description":"If anyone can inspire a Capricorn, it is their Pisces partner. They can both care a lot about communication in their relationship, but their bond will allow them to stop talking and start listening. They are both shy in a way, and in order to get to know each other, they will have to be very careful to pay attention to one another. It is a good thing they will both want to do so, intrigued by their partner’s nature, excited about getting to know each other in depth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem in their communication can arise when Capricorn gives in to their rigid opinions and beliefs. The sign of Capricorn brings Jupiter to its fall, and Jupiter is traditionally the ruler of Pisces. This could truly endanger their entire relationship, for the strict and rational nature of Capricorn can damage the faith and the convictions of Pisces through simple disbelief. Pisces partner will rarely give up on their belief system, since this is what they live for, but they could question it and feel lonely because of the lack of understanding from their partner. “What will be, will be” might become “I decide what will be” and this can suffocate the spontaneity and the inspiration that Pisces partner carries within."},"Emotions":{"Value":90,"Description":"These partners share a deep emotional bond that can be built for years until it truly blossoms. The most wonderful side of their relationship is in the expectance of emotion, the constant growth and their ability to bring out the best in each other. Still, this doesn’t mean any of them will actually change their ways, even though they will be the best they can be. Capricorn might remain grumpy, while Pisces might remain flaky and unreliable. When they are too set in their ways, they could end up truly annoying each other as Capricorn quenches the beliefs and the magic of Pisces, and Pisces disappoints reliable, earthly Capricorn."},"Values":{"Value":45,"Description":"There is a certain consistency in their way of approaching their values. It is strange how someone like Pisces can value stable emotions that much, but they help them to finally rest their mind and their heart when they are in a stable emotional relationship. Capricorn will surprisingly value one’s ability to be in touch with their emotions and have a clear vision of a positive outcome.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately, they will have a real problem in approaching the use of beliefs and emotions in everyday life, and while Capricorn will value coolheaded thinking and one’s ability to be rational, Pisces will value the opposite. They will sometimes be too different, Pisces dreaming of a perfect love, Capricorn knowing it is impossible, Pisces imagining a God with a golden beard, Capricorn believing in this moment, or visiting a church because of tradition rather than belief. It won\'t be easy but they might value each other enough to overcome their differences."},"Activities":{"Value":70,"Description":"When they begin their relationship, they will want to do everything together. Even though their interests are usually very different, Capricorn will be inspired to get inside the world of Pisces, as much as Pisces will want to solve the equation inside their Capricorn partner. In time, their activities will separate, as they realize that things Capricorn wants to do are boring to Pisces, while things Pisces like to do, drive Capricorn crazy – with no plan, no intent or any kind of seeming usefulness. Still, they will both have a need to hold on to tradition, Capricorn for respect of tradition itself, and Pisces for romantic reasons, and this should help them build enough shared activities as time passes."},"Summary":{"Value":76,"Description":"A relationship between Capricorn and Pisces tells a story about possibilities of inspiration. If someone like Capricorn can be pulled into a crazy love story, exciting and unpredictable, this must be done by Pisces. In return, Capricorn will offer their Pisces partner stability, peace and some rest from their usual emotional tornadoes. There is a fine way in which Capricorn can help Pisces be more realistic and practical, while feeling more cheerful and optimistic themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, there are challenges in their contact, mainly represented through their love of Jupiter. It might be hard for them to reconcile their different approaches to religion, faith and their different belief systems. To overcome this, it is best if they both ask themselves – does their belief system work? And does the one of their partner also work? If they understand answers to these questions, they might find enough respect to leave each other’s Jupiter intact."}},"Aquarius":{"Love":{"Value":50,"Description":"The sign of Aquarius exalts Neptune, the ruler of Pisces. There is a strong link between these two signs, and in their sexual relationship, things will most certainly never get boring. At first glance, they don’t exactly go well together, one of them romantic, looking for their perfect love, while the other distant, looking for ways to set themselves free from all emotion. Still, their sex life can be quite amazing if Pisces don’t get too attached and find a way to keep their distance until their partner shows emotion.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a mutable sign, Pisces have an understanding for constant change and the exhilaration and the excitement of the act of sex. Aquarius will happily follow, with a little less enthusiasm because they are, after all, rational. The beauty of their sex life could be in creativity, a game of emotion and the everlasting questioning that will bring even more excitement and emotion to the entire relationship.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately, in many cases Pisces just want their emotions flow and they will end the relationship, rather than deal with constant disappointments. The best chance for a satisfying sex life between an Aquarius and a Pisces partner is in a scenario where Aquarius already had some emotions to share, before their relationship even started. They need a good starting point and the ability of Aquarius to show emotion from time to time in a way their partner will understand it.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Trust":{"Value":50,"Description":"Trust is the most important issue for this couple and it can go from one extreme to another. Depending on the state of their intimacy, they could end up covered in lies or completely free of them. Aquarian nature can be a bit aggressive from time to time and their personal rebellious needs don’t actually help Pisces feel secure enough to share intimate thoughts. The potential emotional dependency of Pisces can make Aquarius partner give in to their perfect lying skills in order to feel freer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only way they can build unconditional trust is to use their ability to feel each other’s true core. If Pisces understand the soft side of Aquarius, the one that lies far beneath the surface, they won’t run from telling the truth. When intimacy is found, Aquarius will finally be able to stop running away from commitment and the problem with the lack of freedom will be automatically solved."},"Intellect":{"Value":35,"Description":"They can dream well together, but unfortunately they will hardly ever make any dreams come true. The lack of reality in their relationship could hurt them both and they might not even know where the problem hides, while they feel frustrated by their relationship. The sign of Pisces should be able to ground Aquarius partner’s ideas because their element is closer to earth. However, they often get lost on their way to do anything real, especially when they don’t feel it is in the path of their own mission.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe understanding between them doesn’t always go very deep and although they can have a lot of fun together, they will have different approaches to the same things that interest them. For example, if they start talking about religion, they will end up in a philosophy battle that has no real value. By the end of it, Pisces will feel bad because they even tried to rationalize their faith, and Aquarius will feel like they have been talking to a foggy image of something resembling an opinion."},"Emotions":{"Value":1,"Description":"Aquarius is distant and impersonal while Pisces can’t wait to get tied to someone from their fairytale love. Their relationship could be exhausting for Pisces partner if they try too hard to find the response for the feelings they might have. The distance of their partner will most certainly exalt them and create a special emotional rollercoaster for Pisces that could lead straight to disappointment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey could make a safe emotional environment for each other only if the initiative comes from Aquarius partner alone. Pisces would have to be completely silent, uninvolved, feminine and reactive. As soon as idealization appears, the fine balance will be shaken and the sense of freedom for Aquarius will be disturbed."},"Values":{"Value":50,"Description":"The link between these signs simply doesn’t let them get too far from one another and their values will mostly be the same, but entirely different in their realization. They will both value freedom of any kind, love for humankind, excitement, change, inspiration and their ideas and dreams. For Aquarius, this love for humankind would mean absolute justice, equality and freedom of speech. For Pisces, it would mean the eternal sound of the ocean as a blessing bringing us here. If we apply this significant character difference to all other things they value together, we will see that they will need a lot of deep understanding to mend their differences."},"Activities":{"Value":40,"Description":"It is a good thing that the sign of Pisces is always open for change, because Aquarius will gladly provide some. Their interests can be quite similar and with certain compromises they could find a lot to do together. Pisces will gladly visit an art show, but why not make it a modern one so Aquarius could be interested as much? Their problem is in the perception of romance and disagreements on things couples should do together. Pisces partner will want unusual, surprising and exciting things, but followed with romance, physical pleasure and deep emotional understanding. Aquarius partner, on the other hand, will want inspiring conversations, intellectual stimulation and preferably some extreme activities included."},"Summary":{"Value":38,"Description":"As all neighboring signs, Aquarius and Pisces don’t necessarily have the best understanding of each other’s personalities. However, the sign of Aquarius exalts Neptune, the ruler of Pisces, and this gives them a strong bond through the planet of all magic. It is not easy to create the fairytale version of this contact, but once they find the emotional balance and the one, core truth to each other, they will have no problem keeping their fairytale alive, day after day."}},"Pisces":{"Love":{"Value":75,"Description":"At first glance, two Pisces representatives might become a perfect couple, but when we scratch beneath the surface, we might see that they have real trouble getting close to each other. Their sex life can be magical, but in many cases they will not even get to the physical contact, keeping their relationship senselessly platonic. This is not a consequence of a lack of initiative, but rather their own need to stay in the bubble of emotional perfection and their fear of bursting this bubble by forming a physical relationship that requires dealing with physical imperfections.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they begin a physical relationship, they could both be too cautious on choices of sexual activity they will suggest to each other. Their relationship might strangely inhibit them both, because of the possibility of unrealistic expectations and the fear of being let down. Fortunately, their mutable natures will in most cases allow them to progress and make enough adaptations and changes for their sex life to work. When they do, they will find the exact amount of tenderness and sexual freedom they both need, and understand each other’s needs before they are spoken."},"Trust":{"Value":50,"Description":"Trust is a very difficult subject when two Pisces representatives begin a romantic relationship. Their main problem is in the fact that they know each other too well. They can both recognize their own unstable and unreliable nature in their partner, so instead of building trust and changing them both for the better, they will easily get caught in a circle of attempts to be honest and dishonest, without the need for their flaky nature to change. The best way for them to create a safe and trustful atmosphere is in a lot of meaningful communication that they both usually find obsolete."},"Intellect":{"Value":60,"Description":"Pisces is the sign of Mercury’s fall and these individuals will often be too closed up or lost to have good practical communication. Although they will share their dreams with one another, and probably inspire each other in many ways, it will be difficult for them to have discussions on ongoing things in their lives. They will both have their own image of what is important for their partner to know about them. It is a good thing they will have such a strong feeling on each other’s point, because they would probably never meet each other at all if there was no emotional connection between them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey will have a tendency not to move from a certain point, both of them intensely focused on the idea of love, rather than actual activities. This will easily lead them to a place where there is really nothing else to share and talk about especially if they don’t share the same group of friends, or have other joined activities that they can discuss on a daily basis. If they lead separate lives, they could end up in a relationship where they simply don’t know each other and crave for closeness with someone else."},"Emotions":{"Value":99,"Description":"Pisces is the sign that exalts Venus, the planet of love. Not only does Venus rule the sign of Libra, speaking of our relationships, but it is also the ruler of Taurus and represents physical pleasures and satisfaction of the physical body. The sign of Pisces has a great responsibility to exalt the planet that is linked to all sides of a loving relationship. Emotional contact between two Pisces partners will rarely materialize, because both partners are in search for someone who needs inspiration, and the two of them don’t need this from their partner.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they fall in love, this is a fairytale romance and their emotional contact is something that no other sign can reach. Two of the representatives of Venus’ exaltation in the same relationship, are love multiplied. Their tenderness and the way they nurture their emotions toward each other, will be a true inspiration for everyone around them. There is no better partner to understand the emotional nature of a Pisces partner, than another Pisces. Their mutable quality will show through emotional changes and apparent inconsistency, but in truth, they will know exactly when to separate and when to be together in order for their love to remain exciting and beautiful.\\r\\n\\r\\n"},"Values":{"Value":80,"Description":"With their sign exalting Venus, it is difficult to speak about their values while they are in a relationship. They will both value talent, one’s ability to stay true, and the flexibility someone has in the outer world. However, two Pisces partners might realize that they don’t share the same values when they are together. The problem here is in the fact that they are too alike and they will wake each other’s deficiencies through mere existence. This will lead to misunderstandings and the conviction of both partners that they don’t value the same things. Not because their values differ that much, but because their priorities might be different."},"Activities":{"Value":75,"Description":"They will most certainly have a lot of fun. Two Pisces partners cannot ever be bored. Their relationship will be satisfying to all their senses, and they will spend many romantic nights, as well as exciting days, in each other’s arms. That is, if they ever manage to meet. While one of them might appear at the agreed point in time, the other will get lost, miss a turn, or show up at their previous meeting point.

In general, their shared activities are dependent very much on their physical contact, because if they have it, at least they could hold hands not to get lost."},"Summary":{"Value":73,"Description":"Two Pisces partners will have trouble trusting each other. Their changeable natures will shift their relationship all the time, and only if they share enough love, they might be able to handle the changes and stay together. In most cases, they will not fall in love, because of their inner need to inspire their partner and help them grow. They don’t need this from each other, because they already inspire themselves. When romantic love happens between them, they might have an actual fairytale story, the one with unicorns, rainbows, and an everlasting love."}}}}')},function(e,t,n){"use strict";(function(e){n.d(t,"a",(function(){return i}));Boolean("localhost"===window.location.hostname||"[::1]"===window.location.hostname||window.location.hostname.match(/^127(?:\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/));function i(){"serviceWorker"in navigator&&navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then((function(e){e.unregister()})).catch((function(e){console.error(e.message)}))}}).call(this,n(76))},,,,,function(e,t,n){"use strict";
