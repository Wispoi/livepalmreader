Their biggest problem could be their possible selfishness. Since sexual harmony is probably the most important segment of the relationship to their sign ruled by Mars, this might lead to fights and the exchange of many sharp words.\r\n\r\nThe worst possible scenario is if one of them thinks extensively about the other’s satisfaction, while the other has no awareness of the needs of their giving partner. Since Mars is a planet primarily connected to sex as a means to continuation of the species, it is quite often that two Aries partners lack the ability to satisfy each other in a sensual, Venus way. Mars will stand for satisfaction in the physical sense, but no Venus – no emotion. Hence, there might be a lack of true human interaction in this segment of relationship. Their thoughts must be turned to their partner with no exception if they plan for their sexual relationship to work."

Now you can imagine how two Aries would look together if they weren’t honest? Pretty much like children at the playground fighting about nothing at all, while keeping some sort of unnatural closeness to neutralize the feelings of guilt.\r\n\r\nWith that said, we can claim with certainty that two Aries in a loving relationship share trust as the same goal. Not only trust in what the other person is saying, but more importantly, trust to open up and say what’s on your mind without presence of fear of their partner’s reaction. In many cases, Aries partner is not full of love and support due to their lack of tact and impulsive nature. This is the main reason why two Aries in a relationship don’t always work."

Sometimes this is the best possible image to make you understand the mindset of Aries, especially when there are two of them, brainstorming. Intelligence has nothing to do with the image, as they can be extremely intelligent due to the possibility of the position of Mercury in their sign, but some kind of strange stubbornness is what can make them senselessly stupid.\r\n\r\nThe usual Aries brain has a sort of need to always prove something to others. Now this would be great if the debate had some calm, rational thinking as a base, but even when their arguments are valid, they can’t seem to stay calm and distant for long enough to make their opinion be heard.\r\n\r\nThe good side of this combination is in fact the same position of the Sun as signification of awareness, so you can see that their main focus doesn’t differ that much. Still, it is difficult for two of them to find peace in communicating, unless they share most of the same opinions.\r\n\r\nMars, their ruler, is in its low energy set – a planet of aggression. When you try to pin previous description to your Aries couple, you may not find it valid. But if you look again, you might see all types of hidden aggression between them, especially if they are tired. It is as if they are used to it and now they simply function in this way. Look again – it may be physical or verbal, active or passive. Is it there?"

There is no better person than another Aries to understand how untrue this assumption is. As a Fire sign, Aries is warm and passionate but it can be a bit difficult to understand their soft side because of their seemingly “masculine” and soldier-like nature. Two Aries can share deep emotional understanding as if they speak the same language.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Sun is exalted in Aries and often too warm for their balanced functioning. If a second Sun would enter our solar system, can you imagine what kind of damage its gravity would do? This said, you can understand that it is easier to be with a person ruled by a planet when you yourself are a star. It is not as if this emotional relationship is impossible, but it can sometimes be difficult for both parties to remain independent, strong and true to their self."

As two warm and passionate people, they can share many adventurous moments that raise their energy levels sky high. If, however, none of them has this rational, grown-up ability, it is only possible to prolong their relationship based on superficial activities and sex, of course. Since the sign of Aries takes Saturn, the wise ruler of time, patience and responsibility to its detriment, one of these partners will have to learn their lesson and take responsibility for the future of their relationship if they are to last in time."

Both planets are in connection with physical relations, but their biggest difference is in their final goal when it comes to sex.\r\n\r\nAries in its rough form is guided by a simple instinct, the need for continuation of the species and the transfer of genetic material to the next generation. On the other hand, Taurus is all about satisfaction. They don’t even consider orgasm that big of a deal if they are enjoying themselves through the entire sexual experience. To satisfy Taurus, you need to be emotionally involved, gentle and passionate at the same time, and willing to put some time and effort into the art of sex. Aries representatives usually get satisfied with having sexual relations at all. This goes for both male and female representatives of the sign.\r\n\r\nFor their mutual satisfaction it is imperative for Aries to develop an atypical sense of touch and work on their sensuality in order to keep their Taurus happy. Let us also remember that Taurus is a fixed sign, pretty much set in their ways, and when it comes to sexual satisfaction they will rarely compromise and settle for less than perfect.\r\n\r\n"

This can contribute to a positive attitude and open agreements on honesty when they are together. They both have a need to search for their one true love, as Mars and Venus always do. This can lead to infidelity and typical love triangle issues, due to lack of emotion from Aries or a lack of self-worth by Taurus partner. Still, if they communicate well from the beginning, they will usually find how important mutual trust is to both of them and try hard not to jeopardize it"

Not only are they both stubborn, but they are not even stubborn in a similar way to share some understanding.\r\n\r\nAries grabs their convictions and simply doesn’t let go. They will kick and scream (literally) until they convince Taurus that they are right about something (consider it the smallest thing in the entire Universe). When Taurus notices this Aries’ behavior, they dig in. They don’t move. Ever. They don’t even possess the sense of sound. You can almost expect a deep voiced “moo” as they get more and more irritated. Their shoulders go up, their eyebrows make an “M” and they simply stand there, annoying their Aries partner even more.\r\n\r\nWho could be this inhuman to just stand there and not listen to a word their loved one says in that high pitched tone? Taurus can. Not because of the anger, but because they are in fact too sensitive to deal with this kind of behavior. Taurus never looks too sensitive. Their Venus role is grounded and strong, but this is a sign in which the Moon is exalted, Uranus falls and Mars is in detriment. You can imagine how this person can react to shouting and aggression of any kind.\r\n\r\nTheir intellect is not an issue at all. If they can find their way through those hardheaded conflicts, it is all the same if they were intelligent or stupid because they must love each other very much.\r\n\r\nThe cure for this condition is in the middle, of course. Taurus needs to set strong boundaries and act securely from the safe zone they’ve created and Aries needs to take a step back and lower their voice, just a little bit. This would be a good place to start"

Although some of the rituals can be taught in time, this is not a solution if they don’t feel enough closeness.\r\n\r\nAries shows their emotions loudly and openly, in a way that is sort of rough and inpatient. They don’t give much time for the other person to give an emotion back, and act as Fire, their element, without much sense for anyone. Taurus may find this superficial, too intense or even phony, as they don’t recognize this type of behavior as love. Taurus shows their emotions in a silent, slow process of giving. They will show love through cooking, touching and gentle words. The problem is in the fact that Aries finds this boring, stiff or even untrue.\r\n\r\nTo make each another feel loved, they will both have to learn to show affection to their partner in a way that differs a lot from their natural one. This can be a small or a large obstacle and the outcome depends only on their readiness to listen to the needs of their loved one."

The good thing is that neither is too sensitive and easily hurt, so this can be exciting and unique for both of their experiences.\r\n\r\nSince Aries is a warrior by nature, Gemini’s approach to sex might be too playful for their taste, but this is usually only until they open up to the everlasting game provided by Gemini partner.

Although this is not exactly true, the sense that Aries can get from them is not exactly a recipe for trust.

Both partners should approach the relationship as if Gemini person was there to teach Aries how to have a good conversation. Since Gemini loves to be in a role of a teacher and loves to be in a relationship in which their partner learns something from them, this should be a good approach for both of them. That is if Aries’ ego allows this “submissive” role.\r\n\r\nStill, we are all aware that there are some Gemini representatives that simply talk too much about nothing significant at all. This would be a reason for Aries to lose their temper and think of their partner as superficial and even stupid. This loss of respect is truly bad for their own ego, since the decision to be with this partner was theirs in the first place. They should remember that there is always somebody in the world who wouldn’t think of this specific Gemini as stupid and that everyone deserves to be with someone who doesn’t see them in this light. When this disrespect happens in their relationship, Aries should consider letting their Gemini go and look for someone who suits them better."

The good thing is that Aries does not lack the fierceness to turn Gemini’s attention to them and make them listen.

This is something Aries can fulfill to a certain point, in case they don’t react on impulse to everything Gemini says.\r\n\r\nIt is not that difficult for these partners to respond to each other’s needs, but if they don’t share similar education, interests and strength of character, they might see each other unworthy of their affection."

Their emotional characteristics allow only for sexual relationships with meaning and enough tenderness. Only when they meet the right person to set them free, they come to learn about the other aspects of their sexuality.\r\n\r\nThe problem with sexual relations with an Aries is that Aries partners are usually not that gentle to begin with. They need to learn to show emotion. For them intimacy is something built, not implied. If they manage to reconcile these huge differences at the beginning of their relationship and if none of them is forced to do anything they are not ready for, their attraction to each other should do the trick and their sexual relationship could become truly sensual and exciting for both of them."

In the eyes of their Cancer partner they can seem pushy and even aggressive with an attitude that doesn’t lead to anything close to relaxed. As much as Cancer would like to understand the straightforward nature of Aries, it will be extremely difficult to see it as anything other than beastly.\r\n\r\nThere is also a problem with the way they show and recognize emotions. It may be hard for an Aries partner to understand that they are loved if someone only asks annoying questions, tries to tie them down and doesn’t want to have sex. On the other hand, Cancer will probably feel violated in every way, unless Aries partner slows down and has an atypical show of gentle emotions.

Their interests differ too much, so even when they are trying to have a peaceful conversation about something impersonal, it is still a battle to keep the attention to the subject in question, whoever initiated the talk.\r\n\r\nTheir only shared characteristic is the cardinal quality of both signs, which gives them a good understanding on each other’s “ad hoc” personalities. This will make it easier for the couple to recover from all of the possible conflicts and misunderstandings. Still, in the eyes of a Cancer partner, this type of relationship doesn’t have a purpose and they might find themselves fighting in a way they don’t feel comfortable with.\r\n\r\nAs their signs are ruled by Mars and the Moon, it is an archetypal story of hurt and emotional pain, so their intentions have to be truly pure. They have to treat each other in a gentle, thought-out way, measuring every word they say.

Cancer wears their emotions as a winter coat and hides them only when feeling ashamed to show them. They accept their emotional nature as a given and work toward realizing a personal world full of respect for their soft side. We often say that Cancer wants to have a family and raise children, but this is not due to their need to reproduce or stay in the house all day long, but because they need a safe haven for their emotional side and enough people to share their compassionate nature with.\r\n\r\nEven though these approaches to their emotions seem different, they understand each other’s depth and in most cases respect each other in this area of existence, in case Aries leaves their impatient nature out of their relationship.

When they fall in love deeply, they are almost impossible to separate as they stubbornly hold on to the idea of their future together. Although they are not two of the most romantic believers in love, they are passionate in their beliefs and when they find love, they will fight for it until there is literally nothing left of their relationship.\r\n\r\nIt is meaningless to advise gentle behavior or looking for peace, because the entire world of their relationship is based on the element of Fire they share. It is pointless to look for peace, when the opposite of peace is what attracts them in the first place. For as long as they love each other and stay faithful and true, they will be tied up in a relationship they need to fight for every day.

Aries may look at Virgo and think of Virgin Mary, her chastity and what we would call a total absence of sex. There is nothing more asexual for Aries than a person without an obvious sexual identity. To express their sexuality or feel sexual at all, Virgo needs patience, verbal stimulation and a lot of foreplay. This is where Aries comes in as a brute with no manners or tact what so ever, to sweep them of their feet with a passionate nature that looks superficial and completely unattractive. The real question is – how did these two get attracted to each other in the first place?\r\n\r\nTheir intimate life can be good only in case Aries accepts to wait and communicate about things they don’t find important at all, or if Virgo was so disappointed in their previous relationships that they turned into a sexual predator, open for an interesting turn in their intimate life."

When you think of a partner who brings out the best in you, Aries and Virgo are the worst possible match. The downside of an Aries partner is their impulsive nature, readiness to fight and the tendency to lose their mind over something that might not be that big of a deal. The possible downside of Virgo is hysteria and continuous, never ending talks, when they are not understood.\r\n\r\nIt is a known fact that Virgo likes things clean. Well Aries is like an animal in their cage, especially if they are crazy enough to decide to live together. This could lead to endless, pointless fights, because Aries will never change their nature, or their priorities, while Virgo will seem like a crazy person screaming, with gloves on and a huge bottle of antiseptic liquid in their hand. The good thing is that before they get to this stage of the relationship, they will probably find each other extremely repellent and break up instead.\r\n\r\nTo good that could come out of this strange bond is their intellectual cooperation, in case they share the same interests or work. They will awake each other’s intelligence, challenge each other’s mind and probably think of entirely different, but constructive solutions for problems that might occur."

Still, as Virgo is primarily an intellectual sign, a sign where Venus falls and the lack of emotion is evident, and Aries usually mixes up love and sexual attraction, it is hard to achieve a quality emotional connection between them. Their best chance for love would be the silent observation by Virgo partner for some time before they get together, because this would give a rational advantage in knowing the person they are starting a relationship with. It would also be good for Aries to think before acting, not a usual thing they would do.\r\n\r\nIf they knew each other as friends, going through their emotional experiences with other people prior to them becoming a couple, they could know each other well enough to make their relationship work. When Aries goes from friendship into a sexual relationship, they tend to be much more considerate and gentle. Without sexual involvement Aries is more tolerant and a better listener, so friendship will provide more substance to their romantic relationship."

When they engage in intimate relations, it is expected for all their libido and possible problems with sexual expression to surface. Attraction they feel toward each other is great, but their signs combined present passive-aggressive behavior in general and as a couple they could have a tendency to hurt each other in intimate relations.\r\n\r\nRuled by Mars, Aries is a sign of Saturn’s debilitation and Libra exalts it, so their main issue is the lack of emotion and poor boundaries when it comes to sex. Saturn can cool things a bit too much and be a challenge to overcome in their attempts to get sincerely close. When they connect through real emotion and respect each other’s boundaries, they have a potential for a very good sex life, as Aries gives initiative and energy to indecisive Libra, lifting their libido and Libra awakens the fineness of Aries, teaching them how to be selfless lovers and enjoy thinking about the satisfaction of their partner."

Aries finds this stupid but easily gets jealous and threaten their mutual sense of stability and belief in other person’s choices.\r\n\r\nDue to Libra’s lack of confidence, it is also possible that they will doubt everything their partner does. Since Aries doesn’t put much time or thought into their actions, the lack of conversation about every single detail from their personal life could easily arise suspicion in the mind of a Libra.

This means that their role in each other’s life is quite simple – Aries needs to boost their Libra partner’s spirits all the time, showing them how capable and brave they can be, while Libra takes on the responsibilities of their Aries partner and shows them how to reach a certain goal. All of this can be quite tiresome at times, especially if one of them has a problem with this unconditional role play, or doesn’t recognize the effort of their partner.\r\n\r\nMostly they will talk about their daily activities and events since they don’t share many interests. While talking about different activities and people, they find a common language as Aries helps Libra not to obsess about others and Libra helps Aries to understand different views than their own. Their communication might be great if they were in the same profession or at least share a workplace, because that would cover the basic interests they share and give them more space to find the middle between their opinions."

Libra, on the other hand, has enough depth to look inside Aries personality instead of superficially examining their behavior. Of all the zodiac signs, Libra is probably one of the few that have good understanding of the nature of Aries. They don’t understand their actions and their way of display of emotion, but the core of emotion and sensitive personality is easy to reach from their perspective.\r\n\r\nIt is safe to say that this is a couple that could solve any issue with love they have for each other and although their troubles could be great, this is possibly such a deep emotional connection that all problems fade next to it."

          "Description": "Aries and Scorpio are signs with an unbreakable bond. Aries is our first breath, Scorpio is the last. They are two sides of the same coin, both ruled by Mars, a planet of instincts, necessities of the body and sexuality as one of these. When they are in a sexual relationship, it can be difficult to set all of the aggression aside. Not only are they both ruled by Mars, but Scorpio is ruled by Pluto, too. Pluto is known for its destructive qualities, usually related to sexual repression and it can intensify all things, sex primarily. So they are basically a combination of everything we don’t want to deal with when it comes to sex, taboos and instinctive sexual behavior.\r\n\r\nThis is a contact that lacks pleasures and tenderness of Venus. Both signs are the opposite of ones ruled by Venus and represent positions where Venus is in detriment. We could say that this means “lack of love”, but it is not quite that simple. Since Scorpio is a Water sign, it is connected to our deepest, darkest ability to love. Scorpios need to feel emotion in their sexual experiences, but due to suppressive nature of our society, can live out some weird sexual scenarios that may seem “sick and twisted” to more conservative zodiac signs. It is a good thing that Aries rarely belongs to this category, for it is a sign where all conservative and rigid opinions have fallen with Saturn.\r\n\r\nIf Aries and Scorpio find an understanding inside their sexual relationship, they will probably become the atomic bomb of all sexual experiences you can think of. Still, it is hard for them to find their shared language. They are, in fact, completely different. Aries likes things “straight” and simple. Scorpio, on the other hand, has a slight need to manipulate, play a game of seduction and takes sexual relations very seriously. They always want to transcend all of their previous sexual experiences and find someone they can merge their Soul with, to possess and adore until they die. Aries is much more simple and masculine when it comes to sex. It is a physical need that needs to be met. They usually have to build emotion inside a sexual relationship as they get to know their partner. This relationship’s real possibility exists only if they share the need to satisfy one another and treat each other with enough tenderness."

Scorpio is too dark and difficult for Aries, as much as Aries is too shallow from Scorpio’s perspective.

This is due to the archetypal “battle” of Mars with the Moon – the rejection of one’s emotional Self and too much roughness in order to survive.

They need to be productive and fully independent, or they will drive their Aries partner crazy.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to bravery, Aries thinks of bravery as a knight’s tale, something to show when you are wearing your sword, while Scorpio thinks it is brave to sink into the darkness of the mind, go to the underground, the underworld or challenge the devil himself.

Although they will certainly respect their initiative and energy level, the rest of Aries behavior is simply unacceptable in most matters. Since Capricorn has their feet on the ground and is capable to measure the situation rationally, they will hold on to their calm opinion about their partner’s lack of tact and endurance or even of their idiotism. You can imagine how annoying this can be to an Aries, especially if you take into consideration their passionate need to set strong boundaries and be respected in every way possible.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Aries will simply have no patience for their Capricorn partner. They will seem boring and as if they only want people in their life to be useful. This will be attributed to their selfishness and lack of emotion and heart.\r\n\r\nBoth of them will be wrong in a way, for they would need to understand what they both could become if the right person or motivator came along. The problem is they could remain stuck in this pointless ego battle, until they both get so tired that they will hardly think of another relationship ever again."

The problem is that no one here wants to change. Their emotions could easily be connected to this first image they’ve had, however unrealistic it might be. So this is exactly what we would call the lack of understanding, because these two could be crazy in love with each other’s false image and crazy persistent to change one another.\r\n\r\nTheir problem really isn’t the lack of emotion to each other (although you could easily contribute their issues to emotional disability considering their Mars/Saturn nature), but the lack of understanding and acceptance of each other.

While this can be really exciting to both of them, it will not be very fulfilling, because they both need to feel loved.\r\n\r\nThere is an excess of masculinity and energy that could lead to very turbulent relations. Their roles are easy to understand with Aries giving energy and stamina to their Aquarius partner, and Aquarius giving crazy ideas and widening horizons of their Aries.

In this relationship, they would have a distant partner that basically supports their primal, instinctive nature. Although it is nice to think that the point of each relationship is for partners to accept each other as they are, in this case that would take away every chance for an Aries to grow through togetherness and learn about their emotional nature. This is something they will never be satisfied with.\r\n\r\nStill, every relationship with Aquarius can surprise us as much as any individual Aquarius could. With them as a partner, there is always room for an enlightening scenario that leaves all things to free will. In case they decide to share their lives together, they should have a screaming room they could individually visit once in a while. This would probably do the trick.

With that said, it is understandable how difficult it is for their sexual natures to accept one another.\r\n\r\nAries stands for instinctive sex. The sign of Pisces stands for orgasm. Although Aries cares about their orgasm, they will not make an art out of it. Pisces would rather satisfy themselves than be with someone who doesn’t understand the art of orgasms. When they end up together, it can be torture for both, because they just don’t understand what each of them needs. Aries would even have some success in understanding the need for tenderness and physical touch, but what Pisces want is like an unreachable wonderland that no one needs. In fact, they simply don’t understand what it is they need. Aries looks like an inexperienced child to their Pisces partner, and although this can open the door for Pisces to enter this relationship, it does not feel that good when they realize that this is not about to change.\r\n\r\nIf they are both open enough to find their intimate language, their sex life has to be weird and kinky if they want to succeed.

Pisces represent a dream land of Aries and they are able to show them that they could actually have a mission and a higher purpose, instead of just chasing through life.\r\n\r\nIn return, Aries partner will help their Pisces partner find their grounding.

To satisfy Taurus, you need to be emotionally involved, gentle and passionate at the same time, and willing to put some time and effort into the art of sex. Aries representatives usually get satisfied with having sexual relations at all. This goes for both male and female representatives of the sign.\r\n\r\nFor their mutual satisfaction it is imperative for Aries to develop an atypical sense of touch and work on their sensuality in order to keep their Taurus happy.

Taurus can. Not because of the anger, but because they are in fact too sensitive to deal with this kind of behavior. Taurus never looks too sensitive.

After all, they are one of the Air signs and in their world thoughts have to be preoccupied, while strong communication is something that gives the possibility of a good sexual life.\r\n\r\nWhile Taurus could stay at home, in bed, all they long, cuddling with their sweetheart and ordering food, Gemini would like to get out and be intimate at all not so intimate places.

In response, Taurus will sense something is wrong and start obsessing about their partner’s behavior and the things they say. This can come to the point of absolute distrust between them, especially if Taurus gets really angry and “vindictive” in their usual passive and stubborn manner.\r\n\r\nGemini’s intentions are often misinterpreted here and this can lead to a number of following situations that will hurt them both. It is very important for them to discuss into detail what they both wish for while their relationship grows.

There are so many interesting things in the world that they just don’t want to miss. Taurus partner could cook a healthy meal, take care of their finances and insist on a daily schedule that would give their Gemini a good energetic base to invest in their ideas.\r\n\r\nIn general, their interests are not that similar, but they can find a way to communicate, for none of them lacks gentleness and a way with words. If Gemini partner decides to slow down a little bit and Taurus opens up, they could even find out it is possible for them to have fun together.

They would probably never have the urge to have sex just for the sake of it, but this doesn’t in any case mean they are asexual.\r\n\r\nTaurus is a sign of physical pleasure. Ruled by Venus, the planet of feminine sexuality, Taurus needs to approach their sexual experiences with the same studiousness with which they would approach any other thing in their life. They need to see, touch, smell, feel everything on their partner’s body and enjoy making them satisfied. With Cancer’s need for closeness and the lack of ability to make their sexual life light and carefree, Taurus seems to have the perfect touch to relax them and build trust within their sexual relationship.\r\n\r\nWith the lack of Mars comes the lack of initiative, and this could be their problem when it comes to sex. In case they both don’t have a sexual drive stronger than their love for food, they could end up in an asexual relationship, in which they would lie around the house, cook, eat and gain weight all day long."

To their Virgo partner this seems almost unreal, for they would expect something rough and scary when it comes to sex. This is an ideal combination of partners for first sexual experiences, because Virgo can enter the world of sexuality in the gentlest way possible.\r\n\r\nThe problem here can arise because of the nature of Virgo and their need to go into detail and analyze everything.

The fear of being hurt is sometimes too big to handle and with Virgo’s view of Venus they rarely understand the side of sexuality that is in relation to satisfaction and tenderness. Taurus is a sign ruled by Venus and their understanding of sex is quite different.

It seems impossible for them not to jump on each other’s nerves daily.\r\n\r\nThe main challenge here is their primary opinion on each other. As two sides of Venus, these signs represent a peasant girl (Taurus) and a city lady (Libra). When you combine this with the fact that Libra has a fallen Sun, their ego problem would easily make them feed on their refined, city image and they could criticize the “peasant girl” for her lack of style and her rusticity. They simply don’t understand that the fact that Taurus likes things comfortable doesn’t always reflect on their lack of style and can’t accept the differences in their appearance.\r\n\r\nYou could say that this is quite superficial, but it is actually a really deep problem with insecurity. Libra is not criticizing Taurus because they are such a fine person, but because they are afraid they are not. Taurus will easily get insecure because of this critical view and dip into their guilt trip, almost as if they always searched for someone to wake the guilt in them, but without the ability to change and accept criticism as constructive. Even if this is not something any of them will say out loud, it can be felt in their relationship, even by those around them."

Their relationship is a connection of deepest emotions and sexuality that no other couple in the zodiac is privileged to have.\r\n\r\nAny sort of sexual frustration could lead to a pretty dark approach to their sex life. Scorpio has this depressive need to die naked and sweaty in the arms of a loved one, while Taurus has the need to be loved this much. It may even sound romantic, but carries with it all unsolved emotional issues as baggage into their sexual encounters. This doesn’t mean their sex life will be bad. On the contrary, they will both find it fantastic, because they will fill it with all sorts of emotions, good or bad. In the end, emotion will be the only thing that is left and sex will be a way to connect rather than a means to personal satisfaction. This can become an obsession and even an addiction, but who would give up on the opportunity of such deep intimacy?\r\n\r\nAs signs of fixed quality, when they click, it is impossible to separate them, and no one would want to when you consider the possible vengeance of Scorpio. They represent the basic contact between sexual planets Venus and Mars, while being from the physical and emotional realms as an Earth and a Water sign. They are the signification of a deeply intimate relationship and a very rich sex life, for as long as Scorpio is tender enough and Taurus ready to experiment."

The first possibility would be the one in which Taurus partner is really closed up, unreachable and too quiet. This could wake the suspicious nature of Scorpio and their obsessive interrogations will damage their mutual trust even more then they lacked it in the first place. The second option would be for Taurus partner to be open just enough to share what Scorpio needs to hear.\r\n\r\nIf they manage to find this fine balance, they shouldn’t have a problem.

Sagittarius would probably think of Taurus as a person who eats and sleeps all day long. There is nothing sexual about it, right?\r\n\r\nIt is interesting though, how two people ruled by two beneficent planets such as Venus and Jupiter can’t seem to find sexual satisfaction. The fact is – they can. Although this is a rare scenario, they could actually use their attributes to enhance sexual pleasure Venus would offer. If they understood each other as two individuals who deserve respect, they could find the missing link for a very interesting and fulfilling sex life. Taurus would take care of their Sagittarius partner and keep them satisfied. In return they would get a cheerful soul who knows how to make their relationship exciting.

Taurus finds this repulsive at best, and if a relationship with a Sagittarius partner begins and they start acting this way, there is a big chance they will get dumped.\r\n\r\nTrust between these partners isn’t something to be questioned and analyzed. If they do trust each other they can have a wonderful, trusting relationship for a while, but there is still no guarantee on how long this could last.

Taurus has a problem with initiative and aggression, not understanding Mars that well, while Capricorn needs initiative, physical strength and supports Mars. In their sex life, this could lead to a lack of emotion from Capricorn partner, leading to the frustration of Taurus, scared away by their libido with no emotional foundation.

It is not like they are promiscuous, but find joy and excitement in the change of scenery, especially if there is relative movement involved, too. So imagine a train, an airplane restroom or any means of transportation in which it is possible to hide.\r\n\r\nHowever, their sexual life can become empty when the excitement has passed if none of them has enough depth to bring into the act of sex.

Cancer is a sign that exalts Jupiter, and its representatives like to travel, as much as they like to feel at home due to the sign itself. Although Gemini partner doesn’t really have to go that far, they could find middle ground in travelling to places they both want to visit.\r\n\r\nHowever, the main characteristic of Gemini is their curiosity. It will lead them in all directions, they will feel the need to try everything and find more new, exciting experiences to share with someone. Unfortunately Cancer doesn’t really enjoy this that much. While the relationship is new, it will all seem exciting and breathtaking. As time passes, Cancer will want to settle down, imagining them buying furniture together and raising children. It is not easy for them to accept that this nature Gemini has isn’t something that will be different tomorrow. There is no settling down with a Gemini partner. This is just not their mission in life."

When it comes to emotional or sexual relationships, there seems to be too many things that set them apart. In order for their relationship to last, they both need to make some adjustments. Gemini will hardly ever change their routine for someone, especially when they find someone’s way of life boring, so the best thing to do here is to give them their freedom. If Cancer falls in love deeply enough, they will understand what their Gemini partner needs, and won’t hold them back even if they wished for them to be different.\r\n\r\nGemini partner has to open their heart and listen to those few words that Cancer wants to share. Even though they can speak about many things, when it comes to discussions of their relationship, their views on it are different. Gemini needs to keep it interesting and Cancer needs to be heard, as much as felt. If they give each other enough freedom and understanding, they could be like children in love for the first time."

If Leo feels right in intimate relations with their Gemini, as a fixed sign they will give them stability and a chance to last together for a very long time.\r\n\r\nGemini is childish when it comes to sex, and rarely connects deep emotion with sexuality. Leo could be the right partner to teach them how to make a real intimate connection if they are not preoccupied with themselves. They will both want to experiment, have sexual encounters outdoors and will enjoy being naked. This is a perfect relationship for both partners to overcome shame and any sort of fear regarding intimacy and sexuality."

Because of their natures, they could get lost, each of them satisfying their own needs. This will lead to all sorts of situations they don’t want to share with each other, even adultery. It is of outmost importance for them to share and listen to one another from the beginning, in order for both of them to be able to satisfy their partner’s needs instead of letting them slip away."

Leo might have the need to, in general, but Gemini partner will easily seduce them to go in another direction. They both don’t have much use for sweet talk and if Gemini tries to use the way they have with words, it could work only up to a point where they start sounding fake. There is not much room for overthinking, and they will both probably say the first thing that comes to their mind. This is a great way to build trust between them, if they don’t judge each other in the process and share some emotions along the way.\r\n\r\nStill, there is an issue of Leo’s “perfect” Sun. This position gives so much energy to Leo that they sometimes feel obligated to burn everyone around them by imposing their will. This is a strange need of Leo, since the sign supports Sun greatly, but it is there. They usually have this idea to change the world and make it a better place, and this can drive their Gemini partner crazy in case they don’t have enough room for their own opinions."

Gemini is always on the move, and has the need to do at least three different activities every day. When Leo has time to rest, they will probably want to watch TV and move from the left to the right side of the couch all day long. This is something that could build a gap between their worlds, but usually they have enough respect for each other’s needs that they can separate activities and be very happy together.

Leo will need to make room for more movement and understand what seems to be “flakiness” of their changeable Gemini partner, while Gemini will have to understand that Leo is in fact keeping them together for however long they are meant to last.

However, there is a big chance that endless discussions will not lead to their mutual understanding, leaving them distant and not interested to share any sexual experiences.\r\n\r\nIf they fall in love, they will use enough tenderness and respect to make their sex life work, but it will still rarely be satisfying for both partners. They are both curious, but not in the same way, and have an extrovert vs. introvert conflict. While Gemini would often like to be free to get naked and run around the streets, Virgo would prefer if everyone kept their bodily fluids to themselves.

When Virgo starts doubting and analyzing everything, Gemini will simply fly away, in the best case scenario. If they have a touch through maleficent planets, such as Mars, this will not end there, but in endless fights and conflicts on trust and fidelity.\r\n\r\nThe key here is for Gemini to get back to planet Earth and respect the sensitive nature of their partner.

This will set Gemini off to be even more irritating on purpose, because they are everything but stupid. In return, Gemini will see Virgo’s obsession with details and think of them as crazy. Virgo will probably not fight this, but sit in their room and cry, alone, in the dark.\r\n\r\nThey need to find a way to recognize each other’s “flaws” as good qualities and they will get there if each of them lets their partner help.

Virgo has a problem with Venus, that is true, but does this make Virgo unemotional?\r\n\r\nTheir biggest problems are speed and fear. Gemini simply doesn’t stay in one place for long enough to build an emotional bond or recognize how they feel, while Virgo tries hard to dismiss Venus and with it love and all earthly pleasures because they don’t think they deserve any of it.

They seem to know how to make everything a little less serious and this will help their Libra partner open up and share their emotions through sex, too. When Gemini partner sees how mellow Libra can be, although they seem so tactful and cold, they won’t have much choice but to share emotions as well.\r\n\r\nThe main goal in their sexual life is, in fact, to balance these emotions.

The sign of Libra is very sensitive to any sort of will imposing or criticism and will recognize it even when Gemini has no idea what their partner is imagining. Who’s to say which one of them is right?\r\n\r\nSince no two people can agree on everything every time each of them opens their mouth to speak, Gemini and Libra can have a very hurtful and tough communication due to the mutual lack of tolerance. Gemini partner would rather go blind than accept that they have a lack of tolerance, but the truth is they can be quite strict when it comes to someone’s mental activity and their opinions. Libra is in most cases hurt enough by the pressure on their personality produced in their primal family, so they will have a very bad response to this behavior even if Gemini meant nothing wrong.\r\n\r\nThe main issue here is in the fact that Gemini lives to learn and teach what they have learned. They often present themselves as someone who knows things, and Libra can see this as their need to prove their intellectual dominance. Even though this isn’t their intention in most cases, sometimes a single sentence Gemini said can be something Libra feels hurt by for years to come.

The problem develops when they both talk too much about their emotions, while none of them stops to actually feel.

This couple needs to be supported by other positions in their natal charts if they are to stand any chance of lasting in a loving, sexual relationship.\r\n\r\nGemini can be superficial and there is no other sign who knows this better, than Scorpio. Their Air element combined with the rule of Mercury and its lack of emotion is close to Scorpio’s worst nightmare. Scorpio is a sign of our deepest emotions and as such, linked to the most intimate side of sexuality. When they begin a relationship with Gemini, it probably never crosses their mind that such an asexual person can exist in the world.\r\n\r\nIf they fall in love with each other, there is so much for both of them to learn. Scorpio gives a strong focus on their sex life and can be very creative when relaxed. Still, they have a tendency to make a dark, sadistic or masochistic atmosphere that Gemini can only laugh at. If their mutual respect is at a very high point, Gemini could teach Scorpio that not everything needs to be so fatalistic in their sex life.

This is where Gemini comes and asks a simple question – how can I be honest when I don’t know what my truth is in the first place? It is ridiculous to expect such a definite honesty out of a Gemini partner when they are so prone to change and have no idea what they will feel or do tomorrow.

Unfortunately, there is not a lot that Scorpio thinks they can learn from Gemini.

They will hardly ever respect Gemini for this, and can try to feed on their personality in order to add quality to their own.\r\n\r\nIn case they share interests and have similar professional or educational directions, they could complement each other very well. Gemini would give ideas and discover new information, while Scorpio will dig in and give real essence to everything.

With Gemini’s ideas and mind flow, there is nothing Sagittarius can’t learn or share, being a student and a teacher at the same time. The curiosity goes both ways and they will spend days just learning about each other and absorbing shared experiences.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that can interfere with the quality of their mental connection is the possible fear of intimacy that builds in the meantime. That strength of personal exchange stops being mental and starts being emotional at some point, and as two signs that aren’t exactly emotional to begin with, they can be frightened by the intensity of emotions that are surfacing when they are together.\r\n\r\nIn general, this is a couple you want to hang out with, every day. They will literally share happiness with one another and with those around them. They can inspire anyone to love and to smile, because when in love, they will laugh so sincerely and have so much fun together. The “here-and-there” nature of Gemini will get new meaning and purpose through the eyes of their Sagittarius, while the search for the ultimate truth can be so much easier for a Sagittarius with the mind of a Gemini. Their optimism and their eloquence will multiply, day after day, until one of them gets scared and decides to take off or death do them part."

Both signs have a non-emotional feel to them, but their contact develops so much emotion that maybe neither one of them will be able to cope with it. They are not used to feeling that much, and when they “click”, Sagittarius could discover the new meaning of life and Gemini a synthesis that they’ve never had a chance to experience. This can truly be a fascinating love story, if only they don’t run away from all that emotion."

Their relationship has a strong intellectual connection, in which they will gradually find deep emotions. There is no real prognosis how this will end though, because the emotions they feel could easily scare them away and their relationship could end only because of fear. If they decide to give in and find out what they could share, with Gemini’s ideas and Sagittarius’ beliefs, the sky is the limit. Or is it beyond?"

It is almost unbearable to watch these partners with their completely different philosophies while they try to maneuver their sex life.\r\n\r\nIn order for Capricorn to experiment in sex, their partner needs to manage to really relax them and open their mind. With Gemini, they feel like taking care of a child heading for trouble, getting naked wherever they feel like it. Although this is not actually the case, this is how it may seem to Capricorn, reliant on traditional values and always taking responsibility for their actions.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, they will hardly even be attracted to one another. If they become sexual partners, there is a big chance that Gemini will find their Capricorn partner uncreative and stiff, while Capricorn would think of Gemini as too unconventional. The strangest thing in this combination of the signs is in the fact they will both probably consider each other boring. Yes, everyone would say Capricorn can be boring and Gemini is so interesting and fun, but actually, the lack of focus and deep feelings Gemini partner usually suffers from, is a huge turn off for Capricorn. All things considered, these two are not actually the best sexual partners among the zodiac signs, but could make a meeting point in a relationship with enough boundaries and enough creativity of both partners."

Still, because of Capricorn’s trust equation that makes their life easy, they will tend to trust their Gemini. Actually, they will trust their own interpretation of what Gemini says.\r\n\r\nCapricorn always goes one step deeper than others, and Gemini rarely puts that much thought into their alibies. This is why Capricorn will read them with so much ease, probably knowing exactly where they’ve been and what they are dishonest about.

However, they will still have a lot to talk about because there is always that serious side to Gemini in one of their personalities that will have a thing or two to share with a strict and sometimes difficult Capricorn.\r\n\r\nIt is a good thing that Gemini are interested in literally everything that exists in the world and outside of it. So if nothing else works, they can always talk about Space Stations, diamond stars and other galaxies. Capricorn is interested in things that have deep, hidden meaning, looking at them as equations that should be solved and admiring problem solvers. They could spend their life in this strange analysis that is not so much focused on details as maybe Virgo’s would be, but on the bridge between different worlds. Capricorn is fascinated by the before and after logic behind every little thing, and this is where Gemini can help them set a list to investigate.\r\n\r\nIf they are at peace and don’t look at each other as stupid, distant or boring, they could help one another build a better understanding for the world. Capricorn’s steady, secure nature could teach Gemini how to make schedules and organize their thoughts and their actions, giving them a chance to move each thought a step further. In return, Gemini’s childish approach to life can be something wonderful for Capricorn to incorporate in their life in order to be happier."

Neither Gemini nor Aquarius will ever be in a serious relationship with someone who is, in their opinion, stupid. Even something that they would call an “insignificant sexual encounter” has to be with someone with enough wit and something to say.\r\n\r\nThey can have sex anywhere and none of them would care. Gemini is a bit childish and can be ashamed in certain situations, but when Aquarius takes over, Gemini will realize that there is no limit to their freedom of expression.

Gemini does have this mellow nature that understands the flow of the social touch with other people, and will rarely fight for their beliefs with someone they feel really close to. This is a good thing for their everyday life, but in general, this can present a problem because the authentic personality of Gemini could be shushed until they are not sure who they are anymore, once again.\r\n\r\nIt is important for them to have enough flexibility for one another, however different their premises might be. Still, it is best if they share the same basic life philosophy, which they usually do, or they could get distant and lose interest in each other.

It may be hard for an Aries partner to understand that they are loved if someone only asks annoying questions, tries to tie them down and doesn’t want to have sex. On the other hand, Cancer will probably feel violated in every way, unless Aries partner slows down and has an atypical show of gentle emotions.

Ruled by Venus, the planet of feminine sexuality, Taurus needs to approach their sexual experiences with the same studiousness with which they would approach any other thing in their life. They need to see, touch, smell, feel everything on their partner’s body and enjoy making them satisfied. With Cancer’s need for closeness and the lack of ability to make their sexual life light and carefree, Taurus seems to have the perfect touch to relax them and build trust within their sexual relationship.\r\n\r\nWith the lack of Mars comes the lack of initiative, and this could be their problem when it comes to sex. In case they both don’t have a sexual drive stronger than their love for food, they could end up in an asexual relationship, in which they would lie around the house, cook, eat and gain weight all day long."

Cancer can’t really do that much when this happens. They can try and be even more gentle and compassionate. In case they are close to enlightened, this will certainly work. If not, they will get really emotional and discover that their Taurus partner in fact drives them crazy.

If one of them wants to do something, unless truly insecure, they won’t take it as a personal insult if their partner doesn’t want to do the same thing. This is where their rational compatibility will really come in handy, as they make arrangements for their time together.\r\n\r\nUsually there will be just enough movement and romance for both of them to feel special, and this is certainly not the main concern in their relationship.

Both signs have trouble accepting Mars and this leads to a lack of passion and initiative in their sex life. However, the tactful and careful nature of Libra can really soothe Cancer. This is mostly because of the fact that Saturn, the ruler of Cancer’s opposing sign, is exalted in Libra. Although some initiative might be lacking, there is a chance for Cancer and Libra to function very well in their sex life if they spend enough time together.\r\n\r\nThe problem with their sexual connection is in their element, more than anything else. Cancer belongs to the element of Water and Libra is an Air sign. Although Libra partner might be extremely patient and nice, there is still a speed to the element of Air that Cancer might have trouble adjusting to.\r\n\r\nThings they would like to try out will differ greatly, for Cancer needs emotional connection and Libra needs contact, touch and experience before they get too emotional. Libra is not often inspired by the nature of Cancer and won’t normally fall in love with them at first sight. Their sex life can be very good if they already share deep emotions, so it would be best if they started a relationship out of friendship, already knowing each other to some point and sharing some feelings besides possible attraction.\r\n\r\n"

While Cancer wants a quiet family life with no interference from other people, Libra can’t seem to stay away from other people, seeking their affection and approval day after day. At some point their Cancer partner has to ask themselves if this is the kind of partner they want to have children with. On the other hand, Libra finds the whole approach to a romantic relationship Cancer has a bit unrealistic. This can easily lead to a lack of trust in Libra, especially if the Sun is in final degrees of the sign."

Their communication will not be too difficult, but there is a chance they won’t share many interests or respect each other enough for it to have true quality.\r\n\r\nTheir main problem could surface if they start making unrealistic plans together. The expectations of Cancer with Capricorn as their opposing sign would be extremely practical and strict. Libra does exalt Saturn, but it is not an Earth sign, and usually they remain in the field of ideas instead of a practical approach to materialization. Cancer doesn’t understand how someone can be so far from reality and this could lead to a strange passive conflict that could endanger their entire relationship. Cancer needs to realize that Libra has its place among the Air signs, in the field of ideas - not necessarily their realization.\r\n\r\nIt is important to remember that Libra has a troubled Sun and usually looks for a partner with more fire and passionate energy than Cancer normally has. However ugly that might sound, they need someone to feed on, and they normally have strong relationships with fire signs which produce enough energy even for their loved ones, or Air signs who don’t really care about it. The sign of Cancer unconsciously calculates and distributes energy to their inner priority list, and they will rarely have an excess big enough to shower Libra in it."

It is a Venus that doesn’t need to eat or sleep, for as long as it feels the unique, balanced love. Cancer will understand this idea to some point, but probably look for a more grounded partner when they realize that this is a pattern that isn’t about to change.\r\n\r\nAs two cardinal signs, they could have a long unsatisfying relationship because they are both waiting for a groundbreaking moment to set them free.

They can really disappoint each other if any expectations are set wrongly at the beginning of their relationship. The best way for them to build a love that is to last, is for both partners to hold on to their independence whatever happens.

They could make grand ideas come true, especially those that need a lot of people involved on their way to become real.\r\n\r\nHowever, they might have trouble talking to one another in the same tone or understanding each other in the first place. Cancer is ruled by the Moon, the fastest heavenly body in the sky, but they are not fast to recognize what hides behind Aquarius’ words. There is difficulty for Aquarius to express their inner state and this is something Cancer has trouble understanding.\r\n\r\nThe best beginning of their relationship is guaranteed if Aquarius sees their Cancer partner as a weird human being that needs to be examined. This will allow them both enough space to get to know each other well, and this could influence all other areas of their relationship. If this happens, Aquarius will approach those strange activities Cancer needs as if they weren’t ordinary at all. After all, not everyone can drink a morning coffee in total silence with their partner and enjoy this silence as much as these partners can."

They will bring stress and too much information in their life, and speed that cannot be handled by a subtle state of deep empathy Cancer has to live with daily.\r\n\r\nThe way they show love is very different, but it can be wonderfully focused on their kids and the family they build if they get to this point. There is no sign in the zodiac predestined for a family life such as Cancer. In a relationship with Aquarius, they would take over the most of everyday activities and responsibilities. In return, their children would get a childhood without boundaries and a life of free choices that no other couple can give. This is a consequence of the difference between them and the tolerance they have to build in order to stay together.\r\n\r\nWhen they do fall in love, they will not be so quick to end their relationship. Aquarius will approach it as a kind of challenge and understand the stability and love they get from this partner. Cancer will realize that they have never been this free to actually be themselves instead of living in a symbiotic relationship they are easily sucked into. Once they form a strong bond, it will be very hard for both of them to let it go."

They both want to learn new things and could travel far if a strong base is made at home, so Cancer can remain peaceful.\r\n\r\nFor this couple to move in a positive direction, Aquarius needs to understand how unusual their partner is, and try to experiment on being homey while having fun. Cancer will have to take over the main set of responsibilities to hold on to the idea of their home as a base from which they can move wherever they want. In the end, Cancer might discover an unbelievable joy of freedom and Aquarius might develop closeness.

The beauty of this connection is in the emotion they share and the way they cherish each other and respect each other’s sensitivity.\r\n\r\nTheir main problem might arise because Cancer can be somewhat traditional when it comes to sex and Pisces partner doesn’t really understand this.

They both consider their day best spent in laughter, and if they share friends, they could seem like a perfect couple. Their main challenge is the difference in their approach to change and they both need to make room for small adjustments in their behavior if they want their relationship to last. Leo will need to make room for more movement and understand what seems to be “flakiness” of their changeable Gemini partner, while Gemini will have to understand that Leo is in fact keeping them together for however long they are meant to last. Their mutual respect can usually overcome any boundaries, and they should keep having fun and building their relationship on a solid foundation of childish joy."

Although they don’t have much in common, in astrology they represent a husband and a wife and are the king and queen of the zodiac. Unfortunately we know how unsatisfying the sex between a king and a queen can be like.\r\n\r\nThe sexual aspect of their relationship depends on the depth of their emotions. As highly emotional signs, each in their own way, they tend to show their love in different ways and this can be a bit hard to reconcile in their sex life. As a Fire sign, Leo is way more openly passionate and this could scare their Cancer away. Cancer is tender and sensitive enough to make their Leo partner feel guilty because of their nature, or Leo could simply have difficulty being tender in the way Cancer needs them to. It is as if a lion and a roe started a sexual relationship and although they don’t want to hurt each other, their primal behavior seems to pull them in that direction.\r\n\r\nStill, because of their rulers, they can get pretty close and share fine emotions in their sexual encounters. Although there won’t be much excitement to them, they could be satisfying enough for both partners if they don’t expect a wild sex life. To find middle ground they really need to be quiet and listen to each other’s needs."

This explains what happens in their relationship once Leo starts talking. Although they shine, Cancer pays much more attention to someone else or to the idea of earthly things they could have together, than to their Leo partner.\r\n\r\nThe base of their communication should be in things that have yet to be discovered. All the mysteries that are there to be solved could be a good starting point because they both need to understand things, each in their own area of dominance. The best possibility they have is in the things that need a light cast on them from two different angles. If they have enough respect for each other, they could learn a lot from each other’s passive and active approach to life."

Their heart is warm and big, for Leo represents our inner child, and their loyalty is unchangeable when they decide to give it to someone.\r\n\r\nThe main problem here is their connection, for Cancer needs to look into somebody’s eyes and feel the love, while Leo wants to shout it out from the rooftops. This could seem untrue to Cancer, as much as Leo could recognize in Cancer something that would rather tie them down than allow them to fly. Both of them have opposing signs ruled traditionally by Saturn and this is exactly why they could recognize true quality in their relationship, as each of them takes their opposing role to learn something.

Whatever they do, they like it with a little intimacy to it. As if to oppose this, Leo will want to spend time at places where they could be seen. Their partner needs to shine to others and hold them by the hand while everyone else claps theirs. This is not often something Cancer will be ready to do, as they don’t really like to be the center of attention.

Their lack of understanding and emotional touch can be explained through the fact that both of them have a mission to spread love to the less fortunate signs of the zodiac.

Their starting point, however, is emotion.\r\n\r\nTheir main challenge in this emotional field is the way to express how they feel and how not to get burnt. As all Fire signs, Leo has a passionate nature that moves fiercely and they can sometimes regret not following their heart. They easily substitute emotion with passion and often burst into flames before they realize how they feel. When there are two of them, their relationship can seem like a chain nuclear reaction that has no emotional foundation.

If they share the same passion or interests, they will have something to talk about, obsessively.\r\n\r\nThe depth that is typical for Scorpio is something that Leo tries hard to reach in their search for Unity. Their conversations can be very tense and irritating for both, but along the way they might realize that they give each other exactly what they both need."

In some cases, they can be identified with hate, but the important thing to remember here is that hate is also love, in its “negative” form, and both of these partners will think that any emotion is better than no emotion. Their a bit torturous relationship can hold them together for a long time, even though they might be unhappy and aware that they could be happier with someone else. In a way, Scorpio likes to be tied through negative emotions, for love sometimes has to hurt, and Leo sticks with their decisions because they rarely accept that they might have been wrong.\r\n\r\nThis relationship can become a very difficult circle of suffering for both partners, especially if any one of them doesn’t have their independent life, friends and finances. When they do, they might find a fine balance, for as long as they both have freedom to think that there might be better options for them with other people. If they don’t find any, they could realize that they are perfect for each other as self-sufficient individuals, through a healthy approach."

Often, they won’t even recognize their similarity out of an emotionally unstable or obsessively stable position, completely different from a passionate, creative one. They have to deal with the value of creation against the value of destruction and this is not easily reconciled. The bridge between them is found in unconditional honesty."

They will both have the energy to follow each other’s desires and they could actually have a lot of fun. Still, they usually stumble upon a problem when it comes to their understanding of certain circumstances and people around them. There is rarely a compromise between the positive, constructive approach of Leo and the often negative, sensitive approach of Scorpio, especially when none of them is exactly true. It would be best for them to remain true to themselves, and understand that there is a middle ground between their opinions and feelings, however strange it might seem."

Leo is there to bring inner fire for the act of sex, and Sagittarius to fire up the expansion, the places, positions and horizons.

Leo has the ability to help Sagittarius when they get lost, and this could happen often if their plans are grand. Sagittarius will give Leo vision and the ability to understand the future of their current creative efforts. Together, they make an important part of the process of creation.\r\n\r\nAs two highly aware individuals with a strong sense of Selves and their personalities, they could build up an incredible understanding. They can both be loud, communicate a lot, and this could make their relationship truly remarkable, deepening their intimacy through openness they share to get into each other’s worlds. Since they both have a strong personality, they will not feel threatened by each other’s character and each other’s strength of opinions and convictions. The only thing they might lack is the sensibility to outer influences and their fiery relationship could make them a bit too rough on each other, and on themselves.

Some balance would come in handy, especially if they often fight. Conflicts between them could be quite aggressive, not because they are that aggressive themselves, but because two fires build an even larger fire. It is almost like they might explode if they both go too far.\r\n\r\nWhen they fall in love, this seems like the warmest, cuddly love on planet Earth. In most cases, this will be enough to overcome any difficulties in their way, but sometimes these partners both tend to forget their actual sensitivity. They have to understand when the time has come to slow down, stay at home, talk about nothing at all and just be quiet.

On the other hand, Sagittarius doesn’t really understand why they would go to fancy places and confront all the people that it is easier to run from. This is not a consequence of a lack of courage, but the lack of meaning they feel when they need to spend their time on tiresome people.

It will be a rare occasion when Leo is attracted to a Capricorn, but the other way around attraction seems more probable. However, they won’t often get to the sexual part of their relationship, for even though they both might enjoy the chase, they will not see their future together.\r\n\r\nLeo is a warm, passionate sign, and Capricorn likes to be coolheaded and practical. This doesn’t mean that Leo isn’t at all practical, or that Capricorn isn’t passionate, but they won’t see each other as similar in any way. The rulers of these signs represent one of the archetypal conflicts of the zodiac, and tell the story of the fallen ego. This need could easily pull them both in a direction which will endanger their self-esteems and affect the image they have on their beauty and attractiveness. This is usually ignited by Leo’s freedom of sexual expression that Capricorn fears, leading to the insecurity in both partners because they are not able to fit into each other’s set of expectations.\r\n\r\nTheir sex life can easily become boring for both partners, and what they often don’t realize is how similar they actually are. The only way for them to have a healthy sex life is to share warmth and always bring new experiences, spicing things up.

Their roles and characters seem to be too different for them to find a way to coexist in a satisfying sexual relationship. The main problem of their relationship is in the fact that the sign of Leo is a sign of the fall of Pisces’ ruler, Neptune. In a practical sense, this means that Leo will burst the bubble of Pisces and endanger their sensitivity, idealism and go against their beliefs. This will ruin the romance between them and make it impossible for them to find any magic while they are together.\r\n\r\nLeo’s openness and directness will make Pisces feel ashamed and rushed, and their sex life could be delayed indefinitely until Pisces partner feels secure enough to get naked. Because of differences in their approach to sex, Leo will in most cases seem like an insensitive brute, unless Pisces start understanding their emotional depth even though it is so different from theirs.

When you think of a partner who brings out the best in you, Aries and Virgo are the worst possible match. The downside of an Aries partner is their impulsive nature, readiness to fight and the tendency to lose their mind over something that might not be that big of a deal. The possible downside of Virgo is hysteria and continuous, never ending talks, when they are not understood.\r\n\r\nIt is a known fact that Virgo likes things clean. Well Aries is like an animal in their cage, especially if they are crazy enough to decide to live together. This could lead to endless, pointless fights, because Aries will never change their nature, or their priorities, while Virgo will seem like a crazy person screaming, with gloves on and a huge bottle of antiseptic liquid in their hand. The good thing is that before they get to this stage of the relationship, they will probably find each other extremely repellent and break up instead.\r\n\r\nTo good that could come out of this strange bond is their intellectual cooperation, in case they share the same interests or work. They will awake each other’s intelligence, challenge each other’s mind and probably think of entirely different, but constructive solutions for problems that might occur."

Still, as Virgo is primarily an intellectual sign, a sign where Venus falls and the lack of emotion is evident, and Aries usually mixes up love and sexual attraction, it is hard to achieve a quality emotional connection between them. Their best chance for love would be the silent observation by Virgo partner for some time before they get together, because this would give a rational advantage in knowing the person they are starting a relationship with. It would also be good for Aries to think before acting, not a usual thing they would do.\r\n\r\nIf they knew each other as friends, going through their emotional experiences with other people prior to them becoming a couple, they could know each other well enough to make their relationship work. When Aries goes from friendship into a sexual relationship, they tend to be much more considerate and gentle. Without sexual involvement Aries is more tolerant and a better listener, so friendship will provide more substance to their romantic relationship."

Aries is all for bravery and an attitude while Virgo thinks of these as stupid, unless they are a part of tradition or have historic significance. Virgo values intelligence while Aries thinks success has nothing to do with it and sees it as a possible reason for loneliness and sorrow.

Also, it is a very good thing that Aries doesn’t care much about “empty time”, such as watching television or opening solitaire, because Virgo would rather read or clean than subject to these activities for the “permanent damage of the brain”.\r\n\r\nThe problem in this area of their relationship is connected to activities that don’t leave much sense of dignity or make careful Virgo feel scared, or the activities too boring for an Aries personality."

This is where Taurus gets in the picture as a hero setting their Virgo free. The gift of Taurus is their ability to relax their sexual partner by giving them enough attention and obsessing about their satisfaction. To their Virgo partner this seems almost unreal, for they would expect something rough and scary when it comes to sex. This is an ideal combination of partners for first sexual experiences, because Virgo can enter the world of sexuality in the gentlest way possible.\r\n\r\nThe problem here can arise because of the nature of Virgo and their need to go into detail and analyze everything. Not only can they damage the spontaneity of their sex life, but they could also affect their Taurus’ self-esteem by finding little flaws on their body and in their actions.\r\n\r\nVirgo is a sign of virginity and is a place where Venus, representing all satisfaction, falls. The fear of being hurt is sometimes too big to handle and with Virgo’s view of Venus they rarely understand the side of sexuality that is in relation to satisfaction and tenderness. Taurus is a sign ruled by Venus and their understanding of sex is quite different. They seem to have a mission to explain what tenderness is to those around them, and find someone like Virgo a perfect student for their teachings. They will gladly explain to their partner what the beautiful side of sex is, only if Virgo is ready to listen."

This mistrust will really hurt their Taurus partner, for they can’t understand what they did to deserve it and they will probably blame it on Virgo’s changeable nature, thinking that they are not that honest, either."

The preparation of healthy snacks would be just one of possible suggestions to satisfy the needs they both have.\r\n\r\nVirgo is a sign ruled by Mercury, and although it belongs to the element of Earth, they need to move. Taurus can be really static and it is important that they make a decision to follow their partner or they really won’t have much of a future together.

Both of them need someone perfect, someone made just for them, and if they just think for a second that they don’t belong together, their search of perfection will prevail. It is rare for these partners to form a strong emotional or sexual bond, however well they might get along when it comes to work and communication."

It is a good thing they can communicate and make their sex life much better through the art of speech, but unless they are madly in love to begin with, they could both simply think of their sexual relations as inadequate.\r\n\r\nThe main problem with the sign of Virgo is their search for faults, and this can be a real deal breaker when it comes to sex. When two Virgo partners enter a sexual relationship, this need for criticism multiplies, and what’s worse, they seem to motivate each other to grow it and make it even stronger. None of these partners realizes that this takes away their emotional or sexual satisfaction, and makes them feel tense. In most cases they just realize that they don’t feel relaxed with one another, often not even knowing why.\r\n\r\nThe good thing in a sexual relationship of two Virgos is their respect for each other’s sense of shame and the pace they want their relationship to move in. Their mutable quality will help them make the necessary changes to make things work, and even if their sex life isn’t satisfying in the beginning, they might be able to adapt until they reach the point of satisfaction. Creativity is the key here. And their training to live in the moment, without noticing every single detail that doesn’t work between them."

They will probably be driven crazy by each other, one of them trying obsessively to keep things clean and looking as if they were scared of any emotional contact, and the other strict in their search for spiritual love and a partner they can really talk to.\r\n\r\nMost often, they are not even attracted to each other, and when they do begin a sexual relationship they have to face the challenge of speed. Virgo will want to move slowly, and even though their mutable quality makes them pretty adaptable, it is often not enough to reach Libra’s speed of Air. They might find a middle though, when Libra relies on their exaltation of Saturn and slows down, while Virgo adapts and changes more quickly.\r\n\r\nIf they find their perfect timing, both partners might still end up unsatisfied. Virgo was expecting a fairytale connection seeing the image Libra shows and they will find so many faults in their partner’s approach. Libra’s self-esteem doesn’t really tolerate that much criticism and they will probably see Virgo as boring, stiff and unaware of any emotional connection they wanted to make. For this sexual relationship to work, they need to coordinate the emotions they give and receive. Only then will they be able to satisfy each other."

This is not so much an issue of trust, but it comes down to it when the dust settles. There is no way to explain to shy, introvert Virgo, why Libra has to have everything out in the open. It is even less clear why so much attention must be brought to their relationship, or why does their Libra partner flirt with everyone that looks decent.

Virgo looks for someone emotional to share a life with, and if they share this emotion of Scorpio through their sexual relations, they will both find sex between them extremely satisfying. The best time for Virgo and Scorpio to create enough safety and emotion in their sexual encounters, is in the situation where they are each other’s first truly emotional experience. If they surprise each other with the power of emotions beneath the surface, that both of them seem to carry around, they will have a hard time ever separating from one another.\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem of these partners is in their relation to Venus, and this can lead to loveless acts of sex that both partners are not truly satisfied with.

Virgo is an Earth sign, and as such, doesn’t often take too many risks. Sagittarius is a Fire sign, and they will passionately force things until they reach their goal.

Just like a mathematical equation, they represent a mystery box to each another, and they need to open it, bow by bow, side by side, until they unravel the treasure hidden inside it.\r\n\r\n"

Their natures find it very hard to support each other, they are both intellectual but in a completely different way, and they will probably ruin any chance of a good sexual relationship by overthinking everything, each of them in their own direction.\r\n\r\nAquarius really holds on to their spontaneity, but who’s to say what does “spontaneity” really mean? They are rational when it comes to sex, and yet spontaneous? That sounds strange, doesn’t it? The truth is, they choose when to be spontaneous and their intellectual strength often gives them the image of spontaneity because they’ve seen the result faster than other, “not-so-spontaneous” people. This could ruin their sex life, because Virgo is one of those people and will usually think long and hard about starting a sexual relationship.\r\n\r\nOverthinking is a true turn-off for Aquarius, although they do it too just in a quicker pace, and they will rarely find Virgo’s analysis sexy in any way. Shy, thoughtful, sensitive Virgo will have trouble understanding their nude, weird and often too fast Aquarius partner.

Pisces are able to inspire and find value in everything in life, and those insecurities and emotional problems of Virgo may seem like something needless that damages the self-esteem of everyone around them. They will do their best to help their partner reach the point of inner security in which they understand their worth.

Saturn can cool things a bit too much and be a challenge to overcome in their attempts to get sincerely close. When they connect through real emotion and respect each other’s boundaries, they have a potential for a very good sex life, as Aries gives initiative and energy to indecisive Libra, lifting their libido and Libra awakens the fineness of Aries, teaching them how to be selfless lovers and enjoy thinking about the satisfaction of their partner."

This means that their role in each other’s life is quite simple – Aries needs to boost their Libra partner’s spirits all the time, showing them how capable and brave they can be, while Libra takes on the responsibilities of their Aries partner and shows them how to reach a certain goal. All of this can be quite tiresome at times, especially if one of them has a problem with this unconditional role play, or doesn’t recognize the effort of their partner.\r\n\r\nMostly they will talk about their daily activities and events since they don’t share many interests. While talking about different activities and people, they find a common language as Aries helps Libra not to obsess about others and Libra helps Aries to understand different views than their own.

With really insecure Libra specimens, it is almost impossible to have a trusting relationship, for their need for acceptance can go a long way and even suck them into unfaithfulness.

When Gemini partner sees how mellow Libra can be, although they seem so tactful and cold, they won’t have much choice but to share emotions as well.\r\n\r\nThe main goal in their sexual life is, in fact, to balance these emotions. Libra is a sign ruled by Venus, sexual, sensual and seductive, while Gemini is ruled by Mercury, having no sexual or emotional wisdom. The basis of a good sex life between them is their curiosity, for Libra is always curious about their partner, as much as Gemini is curious about everything else. Although Libra might be indecisive, Gemini won’t have a problem thinking of a different approach and finding new techniques, words and adventures to spice up their sexual encounters.\r\n\r\n"

When they choose a partner, they choose them for their character and their straightforward nature. Libra has no reason to doubt their own judgment and will probably believe their Gemini in every case, except when their dishonesty is too obvious. In return, Gemini will respect Libra’s need to flirt in order to be accepted and loved by other people. Not only will they not find this threatening, but they will actually enjoy a consequence of this behavior – their own freedom."

Although Gemini will, in most cases, just follow their rational nature and comment on things simply because they want to talk, it will be hard on Libra to overcome some of the things they might say. The sign of Libra is very sensitive to any sort of will imposing or criticism and will recognize it even when Gemini has no idea what their partner is imagining. Who’s to say which one of them is right?\r\n\r\nSince no two people can agree on everything every time each of them opens their mouth to speak, Gemini and Libra can have a very hurtful and tough communication due to the mutual lack of tolerance. Gemini partner would rather go blind than accept that they have a lack of tolerance, but the truth is they can be quite strict when it comes to someone’s mental activity and their opinions. Libra is in most cases hurt enough by the pressure on their personality produced in their primal family, so they will have a very bad response to this behavior even if Gemini meant nothing wrong.\r\n\r\nThe main issue here is in the fact that Gemini lives to learn and teach what they have learned. They often present themselves as someone who knows things, and Libra can see this as their need to prove their intellectual dominance. Even though this isn’t their intention in most cases, sometimes a single sentence Gemini said can be something Libra feels hurt by for years to come. Libra can learn from a teacher, from someone who has proven their worth, but hardly from their know-it-all partner."

The problem develops when they both talk too much about their emotions, while none of them stops to actually feel. They can remain detached and distant, unless Libra falls in love deeply enough to follow their Gemini partner wherever they go, and Gemini falls in love deeply enough for all words to lose meaning."

They might find a middle though, when Libra relies on their exaltation of Saturn and slows down, while Virgo adapts and changes more quickly.\r\n\r\nIf they find their perfect timing, both partners might still end up unsatisfied. Virgo was expecting a fairytale connection seeing the image Libra shows and they will find so many faults in their partner’s approach. Libra’s self-esteem doesn’t really tolerate that much criticism and they will probably see Virgo as boring, stiff and unaware of any emotional connection they wanted to make.

Both of them will want to stick to a certain secure routine, rarely prepared to meet too many new people.

If they find a meeting point, combining their activities and sticking to their shared values, they will have a tendency to become a perfectly balanced couple. The only thing missing in both of them, very hard to develop, is the sense of mutual respect with no passive judgment or expectations. Both of them are susceptible to this problem with their surroundings, and when together, these problems will easily multiply.

Their sex life can be incredibly emotional and demanding, for the pull of their energies is extremely strong and makes them both obsessive and possessive to one another. They will both often get so tied that their relationship seems impossible to break. These ties are created through their physical contact, even if everything else in their relationship makes them deeply unsatisfied."

This will easily lead to the dismissal of each other’s personalities, especially since Libra has to deal with personality issues through the fall of the Sun, and Scorpio doesn’t accept anything that isn’t whole. Libra will have trouble understanding the aggressively clear side of Scorpio, as much as Scorpio won’t understand the dishonest act of their Libra partner.

That nuclear energy of Scorpio is ignited by its preceding sign of Libra, because it carries information on all unresolved issues in relationships and all of the anger that hasn’t been let out because of the forced need for appropriate behavior.\r\n\r\nIn other words, Libra will accumulate the unexpressed sexual energy and it will burst in Scorpio, leading to a lifelong war if enough is pushed under the rug. This will be construed as ultimate love, making their emotional relationship ridiculously intense.

This is why their needs won’t fit very well in other areas of their lives, and they might not be able to meet each other’s expectations.

For this goal, they will experiment a lot, and try out new things, everything followed by a smile and a sense of lightness, as if sex wasn’t really a big deal in the first place. The seriousness of Libra linked to its exaltation of Saturn will give their entire relationship endurance and stability, while their ruling Venus working together with Jupiter, gives enough romance, sexual desire, tenderness and might lead them to a fairytale ending.

The main problem that will eventually surface and need to be dealt with, is in the forces of their Suns.

To begin with, they might feel no attraction at all, and even start a relationship on a basis formed in friendship, only to realize that there is no chemistry between them.\r\n\r\nIf lack of attraction doesn’t stop them, usually something else will. It is a combination that gives in to outer circumstances and things that are out of their control. Both of them could feel pressured and their self-esteem could suffer greatly.

This makes them both understand good timing and usually won’t allow them to make a mistake expecting what should not be expected.

This can be a long battle, with no winners or losers, simply two people always building walls between each other, for reasons that aren’t clear to anyone around them.\r\n\r\nThe biggest obstacles to their understanding are the elements they belong to. Air and Earth are too far apart and it seems unclear to these partners how to reach each other on any issue in life.

As if this wasn’t enough, the entire situation will feed Capricorn’s ego and make them think they are right about their approach, leading them further away from their focus point.\r\n\r\nThis is a couple that has to work hard on finding a shared language to show how they feel and still respect each other. The emotional nature of Capricorn makes them distant for many, but completely untouchable for Libra as soon as they start dismissing their feelings. The only thing that can be done here is find a point of absolute respect and acceptance of all emotions and their manifestations.

They live their life in a constant search for freedom from any taboos or restrictions, and this will help Libra forget about other people, at least for some time.\r\n\r\nAlthough their sex life can be quite liberating for Libra, it can also be a bit challenging for Aquarius because they will be the one who has to fight against Libra’s need to fit in.

Since they both rely on communication, they will have a lot to talk about and will usually find a language to solve all of their issues. Still, it won’t be easy for them to reconcile some of the differences in their approach to things. Libra is indecisive but once they make a decision, they will rather stick to it than salvage their relationship, even if it is a simple meal in question.

The only way for these partners to remain in a trusting relationship is to approach it casually and build their understanding and trust from zero, as if they have never had any relationships prior to this one.\r\n\r\n"

The problem here is in the fact that Libra doesn’t know or try to understand what would make Pisces truly happy. This is some basic disrespect and it could ruin the foundation of their entire relationship. The main challenge here is to remain in a respectful bond, however crazy Pisces might seem to their Libra partner, or however stiff and boring Libra might seem to Pisces.\r\n\r\nTheir communication can be inspiring for as long as they don’t try to change each other, explain to each other how they should think or feel in certain situations, or even worse, teach each other how to behave. Pisces partner can be quite direct and spontaneous and this might endanger the image Libra is trying to maintain in the eyes of others. If they find each other’s actions inspiring in any possible way, they might reach a point in which they will truly communicate without judgment.\r\n\r\n"

As if they didn’t have enough challenges, this will usually happen at a different time. Libra will rush into an emotional showoff, realizing that they have found love, but Pisces will not feel any love until all the dust settles and they have the time to close their eyes and feel.

          "Description": "Aries and Scorpio are signs with an unbreakable bond. Aries is our first breath, Scorpio is the last. They are two sides of the same coin, both ruled by Mars, a planet of instincts, necessities of the body and sexuality as one of these. When they are in a sexual relationship, it can be difficult to set all of the aggression aside. Not only are they both ruled by Mars, but Scorpio is ruled by Pluto, too. Pluto is known for its destructive qualities, usually related to sexual repression and it can intensify all things, sex primarily. So they are basically a combination of everything we don’t want to deal with when it comes to sex, taboos and instinctive sexual behavior.\r\n\r\nThis is a contact that lacks pleasures and tenderness of Venus. Both signs are the opposite of ones ruled by Venus and represent positions where Venus is in detriment. We could say that this means “lack of love”, but it is not quite that simple. Since Scorpio is a Water sign, it is connected to our deepest, darkest ability to love. Scorpios need to feel emotion in their sexual experiences, but due to suppressive nature of our society, can live out some weird sexual scenarios that may seem “sick and twisted” to more conservative zodiac signs. It is a good thing that Aries rarely belongs to this category, for it is a sign where all conservative and rigid opinions have fallen with Saturn.\r\n\r\nIf Aries and Scorpio find an understanding inside their sexual relationship, they will probably become the atomic bomb of all sexual experiences you can think of. Still, it is hard for them to find their shared language. They are, in fact, completely different. Aries likes things “straight” and simple. Scorpio, on the other hand, has a slight need to manipulate, play a game of seduction and takes sexual relations very seriously. They always want to transcend all of their previous sexual experiences and find someone they can merge their Soul with, to possess and adore until they die. Aries is much more simple and masculine when it comes to sex. It is a physical need that needs to be met. They usually have to build emotion inside a sexual relationship as they get to know their partner. This relationship’s real possibility exists only if they share the need to satisfy one another and treat each other with enough tenderness."

From the perspective of Aries, this is something nobody should think about, let alone talk about all of the time. This wouldn’t be expressed as boredom (although this is always an option with Aries), but more as a need to act and stop obsessing about everything. Scorpio is too dark and difficult for Aries, as much as Aries is too shallow from Scorpio’s perspective. What they both enjoy though is their shared ability to give a lot of information in only a sentence or two, but this could interfere with their communication even more, since they might say everything they need to in a couple of minutes and have nothing to talk about afterwards."

Aries will probably never know or understand what happened in Scorpio’s emotional world because they simply didn’t sense anything.\r\n\r\nThey don’t have a strong affection to emotion in general and they are both trying hard to be strong and unemotional. This is due to the archetypal “battle” of Mars with the Moon – the rejection of one’s emotional Self and too much roughness in order to survive. Since there is no one here to keep the emotional balance between them, it will be very easy for them to openly “cut” one another, possibly many times, before one of them decides to cut their bond entirely."

So when together, they would both feel the need to clear things up, but Scorpio will obsess about them even when issues are solved and find new details that need to be cleared up, again and again. They need to be productive and fully independent, or they will drive their Aries partner crazy.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to bravery, Aries thinks of bravery as a knight’s tale, something to show when you are wearing your sword, while Scorpio thinks it is brave to sink into the darkness of the mind, go to the underground, the underworld or challenge the devil himself. This is exactly where the difference in their deep levels of the nature of Mars comes to light. Although everything seems the same, nothing is even remotely close to being similar at all, as soon as you scratch beneath the surface."

Their relationship is a connection of deepest emotions and sexuality that no other couple in the zodiac is privileged to have.\r\n\r\nAny sort of sexual frustration could lead to a pretty dark approach to their sex life. Scorpio has this depressive need to die naked and sweaty in the arms of a loved one, while Taurus has the need to be loved this much. It may even sound romantic, but carries with it all unsolved emotional issues as baggage into their sexual encounters. This doesn’t mean their sex life will be bad. On the contrary, they will both find it fantastic, because they will fill it with all sorts of emotions, good or bad. In the end, emotion will be the only thing that is left and sex will be a way to connect rather than a means to personal satisfaction. This can become an obsession and even an addiction, but who would give up on the opportunity of such deep intimacy?\r\n\r\nAs signs of fixed quality, when they click, it is impossible to separate them, and no one would want to when you consider the possible vengeance of Scorpio. They represent the basic contact between sexual planets Venus and Mars, while being from the physical and emotional realms as an Earth and a Water sign. They are the signification of a deeply intimate relationship and a very rich sex life, for as long as Scorpio is tender enough and Taurus ready to experiment."

The first possibility would be the one in which Taurus partner is really closed up, unreachable and too quiet. This could wake the suspicious nature of Scorpio and their obsessive interrogations will damage their mutual trust even more then they lacked it in the first place. The second option would be for Taurus partner to be open just enough to share what Scorpio needs to hear.\r\n\r\nIf they manage to find this fine balance, they shouldn’t have a problem.

Scorpio gives a strong focus on their sex life and can be very creative when relaxed. Still, they have a tendency to make a dark, sadistic or masochistic atmosphere that Gemini can only laugh at.

This is where Gemini comes and asks a simple question – how can I be honest when I don’t know what my truth is in the first place? It is ridiculous to expect such a definite honesty out of a Gemini partner when they are so prone to change and have no idea what they will feel or do tomorrow.

Leo is a passionate lover, warm, always in search for action and they can be quite casual when it comes to their sexual encounters. Scorpio is sex itself, and the depth of emotion that goes with it in its purest form. When they get together, they could have real trouble finding middle ground between their personalities.\r\n\r\nThese partners can seem as if they’ve crashed into each other with no plan or purpose. If they are attracted to each other, this could drive them mad, for none of them will be able to realize their desires in a wanted way. If they end up having sexual relations, they could have misunderstandings on everything, from their verbal communication to their physical needs. They simply don’t operate in the same ways and while Leo wants to be respected, Scorpio understands that all respect dies in the act of sex.\r\n\r\nIt is extremely difficult for a Leo and a Scorpio to reach intimacy, because they have a different view on emotions. What Leo sees as love, Scorpio finds superficial and irritating, and what Scorpio sees as love, Leo finds depressing and irritating. They both need to give up control entirely if they want to find sexual satisfaction with each other.\r\n\r\n"

If they set the clear foundation in the beginning of their relationship, Leo transparent as they are and Scorpio direct and honest, they might trust each other without exception for a very long time.

Although this is not always the case, Leo wants to show the right image to the world, and Scorpio understands karma better than many other signs. This is why they will probably have enough respect for each other to communicate in a civilized manner. They are both obsessive in a way. Leo will never give up on chasing their passion, with enough energy to spark everyone around them, and Scorpio will hold on to things they care about, and obsessively fight for their goals. If they share the same passion or interests, they will have something to talk about, obsessively.\r\n\r\nThe depth that is typical for Scorpio is something that Leo tries hard to reach in their search for Unity. Their conversations can be very tense and irritating for both, but along the way they might realize that they give each other exactly what they both need."

In some cases, they can be identified with hate, but the important thing to remember here is that hate is also love, in its “negative” form, and both of these partners will think that any emotion is better than no emotion. Their a bit torturous relationship can hold them together for a long time, even though they might be unhappy and aware that they could be happier with someone else. In a way, Scorpio likes to be tied through negative emotions, for love sometimes has to hurt, and Leo sticks with their decisions because they rarely accept that they might have been wrong.\r\n\r\nThis relationship can become a very difficult circle of suffering for both partners, especially if any one of them doesn’t have their independent life, friends and finances. When they do, they might find a fine balance, for as long as they both have freedom to think that there might be better options for them with other people. If they don’t find any, they could realize that they are perfect for each other as self-sufficient individuals, through a healthy approach."

Still, they usually stumble upon a problem when it comes to their understanding of certain circumstances and people around them. There is rarely a compromise between the positive, constructive approach of Leo and the often negative, sensitive approach of Scorpio, especially when none of them is exactly true.

Even though Scorpio can be too rough of Virgo, making them feel uncomfortable and even violated in a way, in most relationships between representatives of these two signs, there is enough rationality to the approach of Virgo to make this contact possible.\r\n\r\nWhat we often fail to understand is the fact that Scorpio is a Water sign and as such – deeply emotional. Virgo looks for someone emotional to share a life with, and if they share this emotion of Scorpio through their sexual relations, they will both find sex between them extremely satisfying. The best time for Virgo and Scorpio to create enough safety and emotion in their sexual encounters, is in the situation where they are each other’s first truly emotional experience. If they surprise each other with the power of emotions beneath the surface, that both of them seem to carry around, they will have a hard time ever separating from one another.\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem of these partners is in their relation to Venus, and this can lead to loveless acts of sex that both partners are not truly satisfied with. They need to show love and be tender enough, enjoying themselves enough, or they might have to move on to someone they love more."

Their intellectual contact is stimulating, often strongly influencing their sex life and their truly deep emotions. It is almost as if they wouldn’t be able to form a relationship without this ability for non-verbal communication that makes them perfect for each other.\r\n\r\nBoth of these signs are prepared to go all the way - Virgo in their intellectual depth and Scorpio in everything in life. This will inspire both of them to search for all sorts of answers together, analyzing each other’s psyche and determining the source of their problems with the world, or with each other. Through carefully chosen words, they can help each other heal or regenerate from difficult or even devastating experiences.

Scorpio is a sign in which the Moon falls and at the same time the sign of Venus’ detriment. All emotions get lost here, as if Scorpio is a black hole that cannot get enough. Virgo partner is already sensitive and when in love, does everything they can to satisfy their Scorpio partner. This can feel like investing into a black hole with no gratitude whatsoever.\r\n\r\nStill, there is no other sign that can sense the needs of Scorpio better than Virgo, and no other sign that can dig up the emotions in Virgo better than Scorpio. An emotional relationship between them can turn out to be truly dark and difficult, but also incredibly strong and intimate.

Even though Scorpio doesn’t normally accumulate things, and loves throwing them away, those they hold on to can be quite disgusting to a Virgo.

However, they seem to lack the touch of the element they both need, separated by the quick, superficial element of Air in Libra and emotional, slow element of Water in Scorpio.\r\n\r\nEven if they don’t make each other happy in other parts of their relationship, when a Libra partner lets go to their instinctive, animalistic side, they easily become one with their Scorpio partner. Their sex life can be incredibly emotional and demanding, for the pull of their energies is extremely strong and makes them both obsessive and possessive to one another.

Even though this is the worst case scenario, this atmosphere will probably be present in any Libra Scorpio couple on a smaller scale. The question is – are they ready to live like this every day?

This will allow just enough understanding between them in a rational sense.\r\n\r\nThe problem they have to deal with is in the fact that they both represent a detriment for each other’s rulers. This will easily lead to the dismissal of each other’s personalities, especially since Libra has to deal with personality issues through the fall of the Sun, and Scorpio doesn’t accept anything that isn’t whole. Libra will have trouble understanding the aggressively clear side of Scorpio, as much as Scorpio won’t understand the dishonest act of their Libra partner.

That nuclear energy of Scorpio is ignited by its preceding sign of Libra, because it carries information on all unresolved issues in relationships and all of the anger that hasn’t been let out because of the forced need for appropriate behavior.\r\n\r\nIn other words, Libra will accumulate the unexpressed sexual energy and it will burst in Scorpio, leading to a lifelong war if enough is pushed under the rug. This will be construed as ultimate love, making their emotional relationship ridiculously intense.

They will fight to make up, manipulate obviously to make each other angry, and do things out of spite. When we talk about spicing one’s sex life, we have to understand that these two are spices themselves, and there is rarely anything boring about them. In order for their sexual relationship to work out, both partners need to stick to that inner tenderness and emotional closeness when together, or they might have to end things as if torn apart by nuclear energy.

While they don’t know each other well and everything seems new and incredible, Scorpio will see their Sagittarius partner as a ray of light that suddenly makes their life brighter and better, while Sagittarius will see that there is so much to learn and enjoy the depth of their Scorpio partner, followed by emotional attachment. In time, there is a strong chance they will slowly lose interest in one another, especially the mutable sign of Sagittarius for their fixed Scorpio partner. Even though their relationship might end on bad terms, it would be a shame not to give in to it and let it fascinate and exalt both of them for however long."

          "Description": "Scorpio and Capricorn share a special sexual bond as signs in sextile with each other and due to the fact that Capricorn exalts one of Scorpio’s rulers, Mars. The physical nature of Capricorn will help Scorpio ground their sexual needs with ease. The main problem of this couple is their relationship to the Moon, for they are signs of its fall and detriment. This “agreement” not to be too sensitive and emotional, can take out any real intimacy from their sex life, and make them too cold and distant, even though physically enjoying their relationship. They might even think that this is all they need, but their hearts won’t agree, and other people will show up in their lives that show them how much they actually depend on intimacy.\r\n\r\nBoth of these signs feel a gravitational pull toward their opposing signs, Taurus and Cancer, two of the most emotional signs of the zodiac. This explains their need to build real intimacy. For both of them, physical pleasure has to be achieved through tenderness and emotion, or they won’t truly be satisfied.\r\n\r\nIn general, Scorpio exalts Uranus, and they might be a bit frustrated by the conservative approach of Capricorn. It is a good thing they can wait and slowly build up an atmosphere in which their Capricorn partner will be relaxed enough to try new things and experiment. The excitement of this sexual contact is something Capricorn will have trouble letting go. Scorpio, on the other hand, will enjoy the sense of security and patience they get from their partner, even if they openly express their sexuality."

Even though Capricorn representatives don’t have to be that honest at all, their relationship with this direct and honest partner will make them feel like they should be as honest as possible too. Any lack of trust in their relationship is a consequence of the lack of intimacy, for they seem to lack the ability to sense each other deep enough to understand if they do trust one another or not. This can be solved if each partner deals with their own insecurities individually and with an emotional effort to build intimacy.\r\n\r\n"

Their similar pace and the patience Capricorn has, followed by the feel of Scorpio can help their understanding very much, but when they disagree on something, they could end up in a silent fight for years to come.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing light or easy in this interaction, and even though they understand each other’s depth of mind and a certain “what goes around comes around” view on life, they will rarely laugh, dance, and have fun together. They might think that this is not even something they need, but everyone needs to have some fun and smile, or life loses a lot of its meaning. Dark humor might savor their situation, day after day, and if they have the same friends it will be much easier for them to enjoy life together. All friendships Scorpio makes, become long-term with the help of Capricorn when respected enough, and this could help them build a wonderful surrounding full of understanding people who love them.\r\n\r\nIn general, they get each other’s need for silence and patiently approach each other until each of them opens up.

They will rarely notice that this brings out the expectation to always be the strong person who they were in the beginning, and making them force things on themselves they are not ready for only to avoid showing any weakness.

They are a combination of Water and Air, of emotion and information, all combined in a strong scent of attraction. If they get tied to each other and break up, they could end up hating each other and despising everything they’ve shared in their sex life.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult for these partners to find a balance of passion, emotion and rational thinking. While Scorpio’s sexuality is hungry, deeply emotional and pervasive, Aquarius wants to be free of any boundaries and emotion, and will have real trouble being with a possessive partner. Their sex life can be like a battle arena, or like a wonderland, depending on the flexibility of both of them and the depth of emotions they share. As two fixed signs, they will most certainly have trouble changing their natures and adjusting to a partner that is too different from them."

It is futile from their perspective, and although Scorpio likes to be in control of everything their partner does, it will be refreshing to talk to someone who says unusual things. The biggest quality of their relationship is an incredible connection of depth and width in only one couple. They will both have trouble understanding our society as it is, and have certain similar perspectives on anything out of the ordinary.\r\n\r\nScorpio exalts Aquarius’ ruler and this is why their relationship is the possibility for both of them to grow. Not only will Scorpio adore the intellectual strength of their partner, but they will also help them understand the way their ideas might be realized through a feeling of ultimate possibility.\r\n\r\nThe weakest link in their relationship is their respect for each other, combined with their static natures. We would think that both of these signs are in connection to change and they couldn’t possibly be static, but in fact, they are static in their way of change, and their biggest challenge is to stop for a minute and treasure what they’ve found in each other."

Scorpio can be spontaneous in situations that are free of emotions, but will rarely let their love for someone be a part of a maybe-yes-maybe-no swing controlled by their partner.\r\n\r\nAquarius will rarely tolerate or be with someone who tries to make them be more stable and down to earth, or anyone who quenches their desire to be free. As soon as they feel obligated to do anything, they will start pulling away and any emotion that might have been developing will suddenly be covered by the fear of commitment and the rut of everyday life.\r\n\r\nIf they want to reach emotional balance, Scorpio has to be untied, realize that their partner will never belong to them and that they are free to leave anytime. They will have to understand that this relationship might end tomorrow and there is nothing they can do about it but accept it. On the other hand, Aquarius will have to confront their emotional depth and be ready to make certain changes in their approach to romantic relationships, so they can steadily feel understand Scorpio’s emotional nature.\r\n\r\n"

In most cases, Scorpio partner will show their affection obsessively, but this might actually feel good for Aquarius. When we look at the sign of Aquarius, we will see that it exalts Neptune, the ruler of a Water sign of Pisces, and all of our assumptions on their lack of emotionality will drown in their ultimate love.\r\n\r\nThe fact is they are both in a way outcasts and rebels.

On the other hand, Pisces is a sign of orgasms, strange sexual experiences and all of the sexual weirdness. If they understand the emotional depth of Scorpio, they might be much more resilient than we would assume.\r\n\r\nThe biggest challenge for these partners is their relation to Venus, the planet of sensual physical satisfaction. Scorpio doesn’t care for Venus very much, leading it to its detriment, while Pisces adore it through exaltation. This can be very unfortunate if Scorpio dismisses this emotional need of Pisces to be satisfied and loved at the same time.

They could support each other’s utopian worlds a bit too passionately, and this could lead to one of them, or both, being in a delusion about what reality is about. There is too much love and happiness in the world if they start sharing opinions and this can become like a drug to both of them. The practicality of Taurus will usually break this pattern and hit a counter-attack with their reality checks and material issues so they can both remember where their values part ways – to security and utter lack of it."

The problem will surface the moment Taurus wants to go home and spend an evening in their warm bed, while Sagittarius’ fun has just begun. They don’t share the same passion toward the same things, and although they might have fun being together, their priorities are not the same. The Fire energy of Sagittarius will be put off by Taurus’ Earth personality and this will be tedious for both of them."

However, every positive needs a negative to complete it, and when we really observe, we can notice that often a Taurus and a Sagittarius don’t even get attracted to each other. Taurus needs earthly pleasures in their relationships and as a fixed, Earth sign it is the slowest of all signs. This is not exactly someone who can easily understand the fast, changeable and fiery Sagittarius.\r\n\r\nThe best possible scenario for their relationship would be for them to get to know each other very well and build a friendship without expectations, for years. In the end, this could result in deep understanding that would provide them both with enough patience to actually start a relationship that has a future. If not, they can always hold on to beauty in the world. Imagine how wonderful their world of creation could be if they joined their forces of good."

They will both enjoy their sexual relations, followed by laughter, creativity and joy. As two children in bodies of grown-ups, they could go through the feeling of shame together if they don't have much experience.\r\n\r\nWhen they meet a bit older, there is a slim chance that both of them didn’t have enough sexual experiences and partners to understand their personal needs and desires. This can make them both a bit selfish, but if their communication keeps going, there is no reason why this would be a turn off for anyone.\r\n\r\nIt is a strange thing, but sex is really not that important to these partners. They are looking for someone to complete their mental personalities, someone to talk to and give them a sense of purpose. This is why they could decide to stay friends after a breakup, for their starting premise was in building a strong relationship founded on their personalities, rather than their sexual or emotional natures.\r\n\r\n"

The curiosity goes both ways and they will spend days just learning about each other and absorbing shared experiences.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that can interfere with the quality of their mental connection is the possible fear of intimacy that builds in the meantime. That strength of personal exchange stops being mental and starts being emotional at some point, and as two signs that aren’t exactly emotional to begin with, they can be frightened by the intensity of emotions that are surfacing when they are together.\r\n\r\nIn general, this is a couple you want to hang out with, every day. They will literally share happiness with one another and with those around them. They can inspire anyone to love and to smile, because when in love, they will laugh so sincerely and have so much fun together. The “here-and-there” nature of Gemini will get new meaning and purpose through the eyes of their Sagittarius, while the search for the ultimate truth can be so much easier for a Sagittarius with the mind of a Gemini.

Cancer is a sign that exalts Jupiter, and will probably make their partner feel special. On the other hand, Sagittarius will make things light, fun and although the lack of depth could bother Cancer, passion and warmth they bring into their sex life might just be enough to compensate.\r\n\r\nThe only way their relationship can succeed is for Cancer to let go of their preconceptions and allows some change and fun enter their strict sex zone. Although they can seem mellow most of the time, they have a tendency to hold on to secure patterns when it comes to things that can make them feel shame or insecurity.

As soon as they start their search for something different, Libra will sense the change and become frustrated by their inability to create oneness with a partner they love.\r\n\r\n"

Libra partner will be able to relax next to someone who doesn’t judge, and Sagittarius partner will feel like their energy is well focused on someone that needs some youth, warmth, light, optimism and creativity in their life.\r\n\r\nFor as long as they don’t brush on ego problems, their communication and intellectual compatibility are a given. The main problem that will eventually surface and need to be dealt with, is in the forces of their Suns. Libra’s Sun is weak, and they will easily give the wheel to someone else who will make positive decisions and moves for them. Sagittarius has too much fiery energy in their Sun, active, taking action and always prepared to give some of it even if nobody asked for it in the first place. This could lead to a subtle, hidden, will imposing and a character shift that will leave them both bruised for respect when a light is finally shed on the issue."

This is a bond that gives both partners the opportunity to understand how deep their emotions can go, as beneficent rulers make way for feelings to surface in a supporting atmosphere.

This could easily lead to a struggle for supremacy and a battle to reach the ruling position among them. This comes as a continuation of Libra’s bruised Sun and a Sagittarius will fit in perfectly with the need to give away every sense of pride out of some childish convictions. The only way for them to be happy together, is to respect each other fully and let each other do what they are meant to do.

An additional problem with this couple is in the quality of their signs, Scorpio being fixed and Sagittarius mutable. This makes it almost impossible for them to share a pace, and in order not to disappoint each other, they both might choose to lie.

Sagittarius is not often superficial, but when with another Sagittarius, their minds throw them in all sorts of different directions and there is not much room for genuine emotion.

Fortunately, their mutable natures will in most cases allow them to progress and make enough adaptations and changes for their sex life to work. When they do, they will find the exact amount of tenderness and sexual freedom they both need, and understand each other’s needs before they are spoken."

They can both recognize their own unstable and unreliable nature in their partner, so instead of building trust and changing them both for the better, they will easily get caught in a circle of attempts to be honest and dishonest, without the need for their flaky nature to change. The best way for them to create a safe and trustful atmosphere is in a lot of meaningful communication that they both usually find obsolete."

They will both have their own image of what is important for their partner to know about them.

This will easily lead them to a place where there is really nothing else to share and talk about especially if they don’t share the same group of friends, or have other joined activities that they can discuss on a daily basis. If they lead separate lives, they could end up in a relationship where they simply don’t know each other and crave for closeness with someone else."

Two of the representatives of Venus’ exaltation in the same relationship, are love multiplied. Their tenderness and the way they nurture their emotions toward each other, will be a true inspiration for everyone around them. There is no better partner to understand the emotional nature of a Pisces partner, than another Pisces.

Saturn puts too much pressure on Mars and takes a lot of its energy. Their relationship will result in lack of sexual desire, the mutual feeling of incompetence or even impotence of one or both included parties.\r\n\r\nWhen this sort of relationship happens, it is in most cases triggered by some deep unconscious need to be held back and restricted when it comes to sexuality. As with everything that comes through the sign of Capricorn, with time Aries partner could achieve some sort of balanced state in which they are sexually satisfied and their instinctive needs are met. Unfortunately, Capricorn partner will lose their energy and the need to participate in this sort of sexual behavior by that time. This will ultimately lead to their separation, for there is nothing light or easy with these two, especially when it comes to intimate matters.\r\n\r\nBecause of the unconscious type of their relationship, they could be insanely attracted to each other, but in most cases their differences will keep them at a safe distance. At their best, Capricorn will support Aries’ libido and control their passion to burn as slowly as possible. At the same time, Aries would consider their partner a teacher and learn about their body and the way to satisfy them.

These signs represent the axis of Jupiter’s exaltation and fall and it is important to understand that their emotional states are closely linked to their expectations from each other and their relationship.\r\n\r\nThese two are considered one of the most and one of the least emotional signs of the zodiac. One of them should be family oriented and the other turned to their career. Still, their emotions often run wild as soon as they lay eyes on each other. In time, they will both fight for security and stability of their relationship, and although it might be hard for them to reconcile these primal emotional differences, they will in most cases simply – find a way.\r\n\r\nThe emotional depth of Capricorn is really hard to reach, but Cancer partner can approach this as their life challenge. When they get tied to each other, it is almost impossible for them not to get married, have children and the entire earthly love package. Still, they could take so much of each other’s energy if they tried to change each other. It is best for them to accept each other’s personalities as inevitable and impossible to change. This could lead to a more sensible future than the one in which they are both simply tired of each other."

It will be very easy for them to agree on what they want to do together and find such activities, only if they respect each other’s personalities. Capricorn will not want to go shopping for house decorations, no more than Cancer will want to go three nights without sleep just because of a project at work. If they respect each other’s boundaries, their time spent together should be truly satisfying for both.\r\n\r\n"

This deeply seeded need to mend what is broken in our family tree is something we all carry within, but these Sun signs are predestined to handle karmic debts and residue emotions from their families. They will have to deal with problems first if they want to be free of the past, and only after they have repaid what needed to be repaid, will they be able to truly choose one another. In most cases this is a once in a lifetime love for both partners, and they will probably choose each other without a doubt."

It will be a rare occasion when Leo is attracted to a Capricorn, but the other way around attraction seems more probable. However, they won’t often get to the sexual part of their relationship, for even though they both might enjoy the chase, they will not see their future together.\r\n\r\nLeo is a warm, passionate sign, and Capricorn likes to be coolheaded and practical. This doesn’t mean that Leo isn’t at all practical, or that Capricorn isn’t passionate, but they won’t see each other as similar in any way. The rulers of these signs represent one of the archetypal conflicts of the zodiac, and tell the story of the fallen ego. This need could easily pull them both in a direction which will endanger their self-esteems and affect the image they have on their beauty and attractiveness. This is usually ignited by Leo’s freedom of sexual expression that Capricorn fears, leading to the insecurity in both partners because they are not able to fit into each other’s set of expectations.\r\n\r\nTheir sex life can easily become boring for both partners, and what they often don’t realize is how similar they actually are. The only way for them to have a healthy sex life is to share warmth and always bring new experiences, spicing things up. If they find themselves in a rut, they might stay there for a very long time, leading to the loss of libido and confidence, up to a loss of any sexual desire."

This could hurt them, or lead them to the opinion that Leo is not the right person for them, however attractive, smart, capable or beautiful they might be.\r\n\r\nThe problem with this couple is in the way they build up emotions, and their best chances are in time and patience, things that Leo rarely possesses, and Capricorn rules. There is no other way to reach the heart of a Capricorn partner and discover that they can be warm too.

Very often these partners don’t get to have sex, because they will have more reason not to, than to give in.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of their sex life, when they manage to synchronize, is in the depth both partners are capable of, that directly links to the depth of emotions they will show through the act of sex. Their main goal is to find someone who doesn’t take sex lightly, someone who is not superficial toward them and cherishes them as they should be cherished. There is a certain shyness to both of them, and this is something that will make them go crazy for one another, if they only reach the point behind the rational distance they normally share.\r\n\r\nVirgo will bring enough change to their sex life, as a mutable sign, ready to experiment with someone who is so reliable and respectful.

With confidence, they feel much more liberated to experiment in life and sex, and this gives true quality to all of the areas of their relationship.\r\n\r\nThe most incredible thing this couple shares is their discovery of one another. In time, they will peel layer by layer from each other’s hearts, and be more and more fascinated by what none of them noticed before.

When it comes to sex, this is a combination that could point to a lack of sexual activity, even though both of these signs find sex extremely important in their lives. To begin with, they might feel no attraction at all, and even start a relationship on a basis formed in friendship, only to realize that there is no chemistry between them.\r\n\r\nIf lack of attraction doesn’t stop them, usually something else will. It is a combination that gives in to outer circumstances and things that are out of their control. Both of them could feel pressured and their self-esteem could suffer greatly. Still, there is an understanding between them ignited by Saturn’s exaltation in Libra. This makes them both understand good timing and usually won’t allow them to make a mistake expecting what should not be expected. In case they overcome all of the obstacles and form a strong bond through their personal natal positions, Libra and Capricorn can have sexual relations that are pretty conservative, routinely approached, and only satisfying if they both let go of their strict premises and conditions."

The only possible problem surfaces when Capricorn is too strict from the start, making their Libra partner feel inadequate, judged, or even scared of the consequences of their actions.

This can be a long battle, with no winners or losers, simply two people always building walls between each other, for reasons that aren’t clear to anyone around them.\r\n\r\nThe biggest obstacles to their understanding are the elements they belong to. Air and Earth are too far apart and it seems unclear to these partners how to reach each other on any issue in life. Still, there is a prudence to both of them that might give them just enough depth and understanding to have very interesting discussions and motivate each other to build a better foundation for every next debate. If they remain rational in their mental relations, they could have a lot of fun that other signs wouldn’t be able to understand.\r\n\r\nThe satisfaction they will both get from serious problem solving might lead them to a point where they find a solution together, Libra puts it in words and Capricorn puts it in action.

As if this wasn’t enough, the entire situation will feed Capricorn’s ego and make them think they are right about their approach, leading them further away from their focus point.\r\n\r\nThis is a couple that has to work hard on finding a shared language to show how they feel and still respect each other. The emotional nature of Capricorn makes them distant for many, but completely untouchable for Libra as soon as they start dismissing their feelings. The only thing that can be done here is find a point of absolute respect and acceptance of all emotions and their manifestations.

This “agreement” not to be too sensitive and emotional, can take out any real intimacy from their sex life, and make them too cold and distant, even though physically enjoying their relationship. They might even think that this is all they need, but their hearts won’t agree, and other people will show up in their lives that show them how much they actually depend on intimacy.\r\n\r\nBoth of these signs feel a gravitational pull toward their opposing signs, Taurus and Cancer, two of the most emotional signs of the zodiac. This explains their need to build real intimacy. For both of them, physical pleasure has to be achieved through tenderness and emotion, or they won’t truly be satisfied.\r\n\r\nIn general, Scorpio exalts Uranus, and they might be a bit frustrated by the conservative approach of Capricorn. It is a good thing they can wait and slowly build up an atmosphere in which their Capricorn partner will be relaxed enough to try new things and experiment. The excitement of this sexual contact is something Capricorn will have trouble letting go.

Capricorn feels this and recognizes the lack of inner honesty that doesn’t seem to change. The problem here is in the fact that Capricorn is the sign of Jupiter’s fall and this is the ruler of Sagittarius, as well as the traditional ruler of Pisces. The magic of life and the beliefs that lead in a certain direction seem to be lost on Capricorn. They know with certainty that the only things that give results are their rational mind and hard work. How can someone like Sagittarius explain to them that beliefs create their reality and that it is enough to believe in a good outcome, to affect the entire web of circumstances in a positive way? This issue comes down to a problem with trust, but in fact it goes much deeper than that."

If they don’t expect change from one another, they are very likely to be extremely intellectually compatible.\r\n\r\nThe most beautiful thing in this contact is in their complementing protective roles. Both of these signs represent protection, Sagittarius ruled by the greatest benefic and Capricorn as our fence, our shell to the outer world. When they manage to build a functional core, these are partners that will never let anyone else affect their relationship. If they are in search of someone who will not allow interfering, meddling and any type of disrespect from other people, this relationship might be their best choice."

Capricorn will probably refuse many of the childish activities Sagittarius suggests, but it becomes fun to talk them into it and there is a note of laughter and joy in these attempts.

They can be saved by a simple word of confidence, and by their understanding of each other’s emotional depth that isn’t easily reached. Respect, however, won’t be enough for them to share the feelings that need to be shared, and they tend to leave each other be, in a certain silence, because of that understanding they have for similarities of their natures.

A representative of this sign will rarely jump into a sexual relationship without attraction and respect for another person, and will want to give their best performance when sex finally happens. Aquarius is an Air sign and this does make them kind of flaky and unreliable, although they are ruled by Saturn, the master of reliability. They will want things spontaneous and fast, without much thinking and as relaxed as possible.\r\n\r\nIt is very rare for an Aquarius to have patience to wait for Capricorn to make a detailed plan, and this will be a great turn off for Capricorn because they don’t like anything done in haste and the heat of the moment, especially when it comes to sex. They can both be very passionate when with the right partner, but the starting point in their approaches is usually simply too different to work out. Fortunately, the respect they will have for each other could make them become very good friends and if they manage to find the right way to communicate, they might even build a quality sexual relationship on a foundation of friendship."

However, they could really help each other blossom if they opened up for the possibility of unusual sexual encounters.\r\n\r\nIf the tenderness of Taurus is projected on their independent, distant Aquarius partner, their creative and motivating side would awake, giving energy and speed to the productive gentle side of Taurus. Imagine the sex life they could have, different from each other, two outcasts, if they only shared enough respect and emotion.\r\n\r\nThey will rarely get this far, for they seem to be looking for different things in a relationship to begin with. Taurus would like to have a secure, unbreakable partnership and Aquarius wants to be free of any attachment to this world, let alone emotional relationships. It is not easy for them to mend these differences or keep them out of their sex life, because they wouldn’t feel like themselves in a relationship with disregard of their primal needs."

Guilt and self-criticism is the most difficult trait of Taurus, and one Aquarius is free from, finding it obsolete. This strict Aquarius opinion will scare Taurus to the point where they feel it is impossible to tell how they feel. This will end in a circle of lies and mistrust that cannot be repaired.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no flexibility in an Aquarius partner, although they tend to show a nature that is so open for people’s differences. In order to build the subtle trust, Taurus needs to be brave and stop thinking about the consequences of everything they say, while Aquarius needs to let go of their righteous attitude and be careful about the way their Taurus partner feels in their presence."

This doesn’t happen often, for Aquarius rarely finds Taurus as a person to talk to, slow and boring with a “small town” attitude that inhibits the progress of our civilization.\r\n\r\nTheir differences are hard to reconcile and when they fall in love, every little thing could become a huge problem and a reason for both of them to think about ending the relationship. If Taurus wants a white picket fence, Aquarius wants a condo on 67th floor. If Taurus yearns for compassion, Aquarius doesn’t care about opinions of others. If Taurus wants to go by foot, Aquarius wants to buy a plane ticket. In general, they can find that they aren’t exactly made for each other, unless they both have enough flexibility to understand the ultimate difference in others, and enough openness to do things they don’t care about just to see if they like them in the end."

Even something that they would call an “insignificant sexual encounter” has to be with someone with enough wit and something to say.\r\n\r\nThey can have sex anywhere and none of them would care. Gemini is a bit childish and can be ashamed in certain situations, but when Aquarius takes over, Gemini will realize that there is no limit to their freedom of expression. These partners will try everything, communicate excessively and learn quickly about each other’s body and the way to satisfy one another.

Gemini does have this mellow nature that understands the flow of the social touch with other people, and will rarely fight for their beliefs with someone they feel really close to. This is a good thing for their everyday life, but in general, this can present a problem because the authentic personality of Gemini could be shushed until they are not sure who they are anymore, once again.\r\n\r\nIt is important for them to have enough flexibility for one another, however different their premises might be. Still, it is best if they share the same basic life philosophy, which they usually do, or they could get distant and lose interest in each other.

Aquarius is always in a rush to set themselves free from anyone or anything, so a breakup wouldn’t really be something strange in their world.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, their rational, mental natures will complement each other in an exciting way, but there is not much emotion to be built in the core of their relationship.

Aquarius, on the other hand, is known as an innovator, someone to make the change, but in fact, they are a fixed sign, pretty set in their ways and as a paradox – unchangeable.\r\n\r\nWhen they engage in sexual activity, Cancer could be so stressed that they will have to set those boundaries and Aquarius will not be able to make the needed change to be gentler to their Cancer partner. There is too much energy in Aquarius that needs to be grounded through their physical activity and this includes sex. Cancer doesn’t really understand this and is convinced that in sexual relations with someone you love only emotions should be shared.\r\n\r\nIf Aquarius finds a way to slow down and not force anything on their partner, and if Cancer allows their rational mind to take over for some of the time they spend together, they might share an exciting sexual experience. Cancer will bring emotions and tenderness to their sex life and Aquarius won’t ever let boring routine take over.

Cancer is ruled by the Moon, the fastest heavenly body in the sky, but they are not fast to recognize what hides behind Aquarius’ words. There is difficulty for Aquarius to express their inner state and this is something Cancer has trouble understanding.\r\n\r\nThe best beginning of their relationship is guaranteed if Aquarius sees their Cancer partner as a weird human being that needs to be examined. This will allow them both enough space to get to know each other well, and this could influence all other areas of their relationship.

There is no sign in the zodiac predestined for a family life such as Cancer. In a relationship with Aquarius, they would take over the most of everyday activities and responsibilities. In return, their children would get a childhood without boundaries and a life of free choices that no other couple can give. This is a consequence of the difference between them and the tolerance they have to build in order to stay together.\r\n\r\nWhen they do fall in love, they will not be so quick to end their relationship. Aquarius will approach it as a kind of challenge and understand the stability and love they get from this partner.

Aquarius will in most cases avoid doctors at all costs and the fact that they exalt Neptune will mostly turn them to all sorts of alternative medicine, rather than anything typical that Virgo might hold on to.\r\n\r\nThe entire emotional world of their relationship could come down to Virgo worrying for their irresponsible Aquarius partner, and the lack of gratitude they might get in return. In fact, Aquarius usually doesn’t need to be taken care of in this way. This is a complicated emotional relationship because the worrying of Virgo degrades the personality of Aquarius and the best of intentions could have damaging consequences.\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem in the relationship of Virgo and Aquarius is in the fact they both heavily rely on their rational mind. This leaves no room for the joy of seduction, love and satisfaction, and usually they both need a partner with more warmth, life or emotion to them so they could both be happier."

The problems with Libra’s Sun bring too much concern for opinions of other people, so representatives of this sing go to extremes when it comes to the way they show their sexuality. They will either be afraid to be judged and seem too asexual, or have a need to show it “in spite” of everyone’s opinion and this can be quite repulsive for their partner. When it comes to sexuality, Aquarius has an entirely different approach – they simply don’t care about anyone’s opinion. They live their life in a constant search for freedom from any taboos or restrictions, and this will help Libra forget about other people, at least for some time.\r\n\r\nAlthough their sex life can be quite liberating for Libra, it can also be a bit challenging for Aquarius because they will be the one who has to fight against Libra’s need to fit in. However, as two Air signs, they will both tend to be free to express their sexual desires to each other. They will like to experiment, learn about each other and their own inner desires and communicate with ease. Their sexual relations should be a strong pillar of their entire relationship, although they will usually think of their verbal ways to get along as the most important for their bond.\r\n\r\n"

Both of these signs like to be attractive to different people and they should find a way to communicate this need in the right way. The problem can arise when Libra starts to get attached and becomes emotionally dependent on their partner.

Since they both rely on communication, they will have a lot to talk about and will usually find a language to solve all of their issues. Still, it won’t be easy for them to reconcile some of the differences in their approach to things. Libra is indecisive but once they make a decision, they will rather stick to it than salvage their relationship, even if it is a simple meal in question. Aquarius will have a tendency to walk away as soon as they feel pressured into anything, even if it is that same meal. So basically, they could have an enormous problem about lunch if we talk about extremes.\r\n\r\nStill, they usually understand each other well on usual, daily things and have similar convictions that help them handle big changes in life well.

They have strangely different goals in life, but if they harmonize them, their emotional bond should be very strong and develop much faster than we would anticipate.\r\n\r\nThe biggest obstacle that could present in their way is marriage, at some point in their relationship. Libra is a sign that represents marriage and finds it very meaningful as the institution Saturn would support. Aquarius might think of it as obsolete, even run from it and they will probably enter it only for practical reasons.

They are a combination of Water and Air, of emotion and information, all combined in a strong scent of attraction. If they get tied to each other and break up, they could end up hating each other and despising everything they’ve shared in their sex life.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult for these partners to find a balance of passion, emotion and rational thinking. While Scorpio’s sexuality is hungry, deeply emotional and pervasive, Aquarius wants to be free of any boundaries and emotion, and will have real trouble being with a possessive partner. Their sex life can be like a battle arena, or like a wonderland, depending on the flexibility of both of them and the depth of emotions they share.

The biggest quality of their relationship is an incredible connection of depth and width in only one couple. They will both have trouble understanding our society as it is, and have certain similar perspectives on anything out of the ordinary.\r\n\r\nScorpio exalts Aquarius’ ruler and this is why their relationship is the possibility for both of them to grow. Not only will Scorpio adore the intellectual strength of their partner, but they will also help them understand the way their ideas might be realized through a feeling of ultimate possibility.\r\n\r\nThe weakest link in their relationship is their respect for each other, combined with their static natures. We would think that both of these signs are in connection to change and they couldn’t possibly be static, but in fact, they are static in their way of change, and their biggest challenge is to stop for a minute and treasure what they’ve found in each other."

As soon as they feel obligated to do anything, they will start pulling away and any emotion that might have been developing will suddenly be covered by the fear of commitment and the rut of everyday life.\r\n\r\nIf they want to reach emotional balance, Scorpio has to be untied, realize that their partner will never belong to them and that they are free to leave anytime. They will have to understand that this relationship might end tomorrow and there is nothing they can do about it but accept it. On the other hand, Aquarius will have to confront their emotional depth and be ready to make certain changes in their approach to romantic relationships, so they can steadily feel understand Scorpio’s emotional nature.\r\n\r\n"

In most cases, Scorpio partner will show their affection obsessively, but this might actually feel good for Aquarius. When we look at the sign of Aquarius, we will see that it exalts Neptune, the ruler of a Water sign of Pisces, and all of our assumptions on their lack of emotionality will drown in their ultimate love.\r\n\r\nThe fact is they are both in a way outcasts and rebels.

They will want things spontaneous and fast, without much thinking and as relaxed as possible.\r\n\r\nIt is very rare for an Aquarius to have patience to wait for Capricorn to make a detailed plan, and this will be a great turn off for Capricorn because they don’t like anything done in haste and the heat of the moment, especially when it comes to sex. They can both be very passionate when with the right partner, but the starting point in their approaches is usually simply too different to work out.

This could be the reason of a very unpleasant conflict between their personalities, for both of these partners have the need to set strong boundaries and easily get lost in their extreme individualities. The best cure for this situation is for each of them to slow down, breathe in, and ask themselves – do they really give each other enough freedom to be who they are?"

The beauty of their love is in its detachment, however strange that may sound.

As a sign that carries opposition within, they are often not easy to be with for any sign of the zodiac, but this is exactly something both of them could understand in each other. If they truly respect each other, there is a great chance they will learn to understand other things in each other’s lives too.\r\n\r\nAs crazy as it may sound, these two partners have a great chance of staying together because they will know each other better than anyone else could.

At first glance, they don’t exactly go well together, one of them romantic, looking for their perfect love, while the other distant, looking for ways to set themselves free from all emotion. Still, their sex life can be quite amazing if Pisces don’t get too attached and find a way to keep their distance until their partner shows emotion.\r\n\r\nAs a mutable sign, Pisces have an understanding for constant change and the exhilaration and the excitement of the act of sex. Aquarius will happily follow, with a little less enthusiasm because they are, after all, rational. The beauty of their sex life could be in creativity, a game of emotion and the everlasting questioning that will bring even more excitement and emotion to the entire relationship.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, in many cases Pisces just want their emotions flow and they will end the relationship, rather than deal with constant disappointments. The best chance for a satisfying sex life between an Aquarius and a Pisces partner is in a scenario where Aquarius already had some emotions to share, before their relationship even started. They need a good starting point and the ability of Aquarius to show emotion from time to time in a way their partner will understand it.\r\n\r\n"

The potential emotional dependency of Pisces can make Aquarius partner give in to their perfect lying skills in order to feel freer.\r\n\r\nThe only way they can build unconditional trust is to use their ability to feel each other’s true core. If Pisces understand the soft side of Aquarius, the one that lies far beneath the surface, they won’t run from telling the truth.

With that said, it is understandable how difficult it is for their sexual natures to accept one another.\r\n\r\nAries stands for instinctive sex. The sign of Pisces stands for orgasm. Although Aries cares about their orgasm, they will not make an art out of it. Pisces would rather satisfy themselves than be with someone who doesn’t understand the art of orgasms. When they end up together, it can be torture for both, because they just don’t understand what each of them needs. Aries would even have some success in understanding the need for tenderness and physical touch, but what Pisces want is like an unreachable wonderland that no one needs. In fact, they simply don’t understand what it is they need. Aries looks like an inexperienced child to their Pisces partner, and although this can open the door for Pisces to enter this relationship, it does not feel that good when they realize that this is not about to change.\r\n\r\nIf they are both open enough to find their intimate language, their sex life has to be weird and kinky if they want to succeed.

Pisces represent a dream land of Aries and they are able to show them that they could actually have a mission and a higher purpose, instead of just chasing through life.\r\n\r\nIn return, Aries partner will help their Pisces partner find their grounding. They will not be that gentle about it, that is guaranteed, but could be realistic just enough to show Pisces how important it is to have initiative and build something you dream about in the real world.

Pisces will bring in change, creativity, inspiration and probably a lot of sensuality due to the fact that this is the sign that exalts Venus. The beauty of this connection is in the emotion they share and the way they cherish each other and respect each other’s sensitivity.\r\n\r\nTheir main problem might arise because Cancer can be somewhat traditional when it comes to sex and Pisces partner doesn’t really understand this. Pisces’ need to connect and feel love is larger than any sort of rule humankind might have made for love. However, in most cases they will be tender enough to inspire their Cancer partner to let go of their rigid attitudes and shame, and give in to the beauty of sexual exchange of emotions.\r\n\r\n"

Their roles and characters seem to be too different for them to find a way to coexist in a satisfying sexual relationship. The main problem of their relationship is in the fact that the sign of Leo is a sign of the fall of Pisces’ ruler, Neptune. In a practical sense, this means that Leo will burst the bubble of Pisces and endanger their sensitivity, idealism and go against their beliefs. This will ruin the romance between them and make it impossible for them to find any magic while they are together.\r\n\r\nLeo’s openness and directness will make Pisces feel ashamed and rushed, and their sex life could be delayed indefinitely until Pisces partner feels secure enough to get naked. Because of differences in their approach to sex, Leo will in most cases seem like an insensitive brute, unless Pisces start understanding their emotional depth even though it is so different from theirs.

The main problem with the time they spend together could be the unconscious negativity of Scorpio partner. It might endanger the positive, happy image of the world Pisces want to carry around and this could push Pisces partner away if their emotional connection is not strong enough to keep them together."

They will both easily get carried away into an image of a fairytale love, and this image could keep them together for a very long time, even if they are both not that happy. As two Water signs, they will rely on their emotional judgments and understand this about each other, creating true intimacy. The challenge here is for the nature of Scorpio not to obsess and suffocate their changeable partner, and for Pisces to stop running away from negative emotions.\r\n\r\n"

Their relationship might strangely inhibit them both, because of the possibility of unrealistic expectations and the fear of being let down.

This will easily lead them to a place where there is really nothing else to share and talk about especially if they don’t share the same group of friends, or have other joined activities that they can discuss on a daily basis.

Their sexual relationship is a contact of two powerful individuals, one of them extremely strict and rational, and another flexible and emotional but confident about their beliefs. Differences between them will create a strong attraction, almost as if they were opposing signs.\r\n\r\nThe sex life these partners can share is unexplainable when their characters are superficially observed. But in a different way than a Cancer, Pisces can reach emotional depth of Capricorn by a simple feel. This is not a matter of compassion, but a matter of their deep inner truths. Capricorn isn’t unemotional, however obvious their coldness might be, and Pisces can be quite rational, even though they seem lost in emotion. They can awaken the best qualities in each other and share strong intimacy through deep emotionally-rational understanding.\r\n\r\nTheir sex life will move in a strangely spontaneous way. Capricorn will be inspired to let go and open up to their partner, while Pisces will easily ground their affections and find a way to show them through physical contact. Capricorn will feel more casual and Pisces will start to gather themselves up. If they stay together for long enough, they could make a perfect blend of stability, trust and emotional excitement."

On the other hand, if Capricorn is closed up and unreachable, trust will be disturbed by a simple fact that they don’t know each other that well at all. The beauty of their relationship is in their approach to trust when they realize who they are dealing with. Since both of the partners don’t trust the world to open up easily, they will have to earn it, day by day, from each other.

It is a good thing they will both want to do so, intrigued by their partner’s nature, excited about getting to know each other in depth.\r\n\r\nThe problem in their communication can arise when Capricorn gives in to their rigid opinions and beliefs. The sign of Capricorn brings Jupiter to its fall, and Jupiter is traditionally the ruler of Pisces. This could truly endanger their entire relationship, for the strict and rational nature of Capricorn can damage the faith and the convictions of Pisces through simple disbelief. Pisces partner will rarely give up on their belief system, since this is what they live for, but they could question it and feel lonely because of the lack of understanding from their partner. “What will be, will be” might become “I decide what will be” and this can suffocate the spontaneity and the inspiration that Pisces partner carries within."

There is a fine way in which Capricorn can help Pisces be more realistic and practical, while feeling more cheerful and optimistic themselves.\r\n\r\nStill, there are challenges in their contact, mainly represented through their love of Jupiter. It might be hard for them to reconcile their different approaches to religion, faith and their different belief systems.

Aquarius will happily follow, with a little less enthusiasm because they are, after all, rational. The beauty of their sex life could be in creativity, a game of emotion and the everlasting questioning that will bring even more excitement and emotion to the entire relationship.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, in many cases Pisces just want their emotions flow and they will end the relationship, rather than deal with constant disappointments. The best chance for a satisfying sex life between an Aquarius and a Pisces partner is in a scenario where Aquarius already had some emotions to share, before their relationship even started.

The potential emotional dependency of Pisces can make Aquarius partner give in to their perfect lying skills in order to feel freer.\r\n\r\nThe only way they can build unconditional trust is to use their ability to feel each other’s true core.
